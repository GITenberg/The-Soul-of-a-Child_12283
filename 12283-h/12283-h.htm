<br>
<p>The oldest part of Stockholm is a little rocky island. Once it
was the whole city. Popularly it is still spoken of as "The City."
At one end of it stands the huge square-cut pile of the Royal
Palace, looking with solemn indifference toward the more modern
quarters across the ever hurried waters of the North River. Nearer
the centre, and at the very top of the island, lies an open place
called Great Square, which used to play a most important part in
Swedish history, but which now serves no better purpose than to
house the open-air toy market that operates the last week before
Christmas.</p>
<p>Long narrow streets loop concentrically about Great Square. They
are lined with massive structures of stone and brick, four and five
stories high, that used to be the homes of court and government
officials, of army and navy officers, of burghers made prosperous
by an extensive domestic and foreign trade, while on the ground
floors were located the choicest shops of the country's capital.
The shops are still there, but they have grown dingy and cheap, and
they administer only to the casual needs of the humble middle-class
people crowded into the old-fashioned, gloomy apartments above.</p>
<p>From the square to the water-fronts radiate a number of still
more narrow and squalid lanes, harbouring a population which is
held inferior to that of the streets in social rank without yet
being willing to have itself classed with the manual toilers of the
suburbs. Halfway down the slope of such a lane, and almost within
the shadow of the palace, stood the house where Keith first arrived
at some sort of consciousness of himself and the surrounding
world.</p>
<p>On the fourth floor his parents occupied a three-room flat. The
parlour and the living-room had two windows each, looking into the
lane. The kitchen in the rear opened a single window on the
narrowest, barest, darkest courtyard you ever saw, its one
redeeming feature being a glimpse of sky above the red-tiled roof
of the building opposite.</p>
<p>In such surroundings Keith spent the better part of his first
sixteen years.</p>
<p>He was an only son, much loved, and one of his first conscious
realizations was a sharp sense of restraint, as if he had been tied
to a string by which he was pulled back as soon as anything
promised to become interesting.</p>
<p>At first he thought the world made up entirely of those three
rooms, where he, his parents, Granny--his maternal grandmother--and
a more or less transient servant girl had lived for ever. Visitors
drifted in, of course, but he seemed to think that they had come
from nowhere and would return to the same place. What instilled the
first idea of a wider outside world in his mind was leaning out
through one of the windows, with his mother's arm clutched tightly
about his waist.</p>
<p>There was something symbolic in that clutch, for his mother was
always full of fear that dire things befall him. She was afraid of
many other things besides, and the need of being constantly worried
was probably his second clear realization.</p>
<p>But the clasp of his mother's arm was soft and tender for all
that. Her inclination to humour him in sundry respects not implying
too much freedom of movement contrasted favourably with the sterner
restraint exercised by his father. And so it was only natural that,
to begin with, he should cling no less closely to her than she to
him.</p>
<p>Leaning out of the front windows was one of the favorite
pursuits of his earliest childhood, and during the summer it could
be indulged to a reasonable extent.</p>
<p>Across the lane, not more than twenty-five feet distant, was
another building, the upper parts of which he could see even when
the windows were closed. It was much darker of aspect than their
own house, and he knew that no people lived in it. He called it the
distillery, just as he heard his parents do, without knowing what
the word meant. Staring as he might into its dark windows, he could
as a rule see nothing but the grimy panes, because in the back of
it there was no courtyard at all--nothing but a solid wall without
a single opening in it.</p>
<p>Now and then however, he would spy the flickering light of an
open-wick lamp move about on the floor level with their own. In the
fitful, smoke-enshrouded glow of that lamp he would catch fleeting
glimpses of clumsy figures and spooklike faces bending over huge
round objects, while at the same time, if the windows were open, he
would hear much mysterious tapping and knocking. It was all very
puzzling and not quite pleasant, so that on midwinter afternoons,
when he was still awake after dark, he would not care to look very
long at the house opposite, and the drawing of the shades came as
an actual relief.</p>
<p>Letting his glance drop straight down from one of their windows,
he saw, at a dizzying depth, the cobbles of the lane, lined on
either side by a gutter made out of huge smooth stones. There was
often water in the gutter even on dry days, when the intense
blueness of the sky-strip overhead showed that the sun must be
shining brightly. Sometimes the water was thick and beautifully
coloured, and then he yearned to get down and put his hands into
it. But to do so, he gathered from his mother, would not only be
dangerous and contrary to her will and wish, but quite out of the
question for some other reason that he could not grasp. His
mother's standing expression for it was:</p>
<p>"No <i>nice</i> little boy would ever do that."</p>
<p>Keith's third realization in the way of self-consciousness was
an uneasy doubt of his own inherent nicety, for he soon discovered
that whatever was thus particularly forbidden seemed to himself
particularly desirable.</p>
<p>At times he saw children playing down there--perhaps in the very
gutter for which he was longing. To him they appeared entirely like
himself, but to his mother's eye they were evidently objectionable
in the same way as the gutter. There were not many of them,
however, and it was a long time before two or three of them began
to return with sufficient regularity to assume a distinct identity
in his mind.</p>
<p>Older people came and went, but never many of them, and hardly
ever more than one or two at a time. Nor did he care very much.
More attractive was the sight of long, horse-drawn carts with
narrow bodies resting on two small wheels set about the centre.
Generally they stopped in front of the distillery to load or unload
heavy casks or barrels of varying size. The loading was more
exciting by far, especially when the barrels were large, for then
the men had to use all their strength to roll them up the gangway
of two loose beams laid from the pavement to the cart, and to time
their efforts they shouted or chanted noisily--much to Keith's joy
and the disgust of his mother. On such occasions the air of the
lane was apt to take on a special pungency, and as he sniffed it,
he would have a sensation of mixed pleasure and revulsion. At other
times when the carts stopped in front of the warehouse below the
distillery, odours of an exclusively enjoyable character would
tickle his nostrils--odours that later he might encounter in their
own kitchen and identify with matters pleasing to the palate as
well as to the nose.</p>
<p>There were in all only eight houses on both sides of the lane.
Four of these were the rear parts of the corner houses facing
respectively on the Quay, at the foot of the lane and on East Long
Street, at its head. Beyond the latter there was nothing but
another wall full of windows, just like the walls flanking the lane
itself. The traffic on the street was more lively and varied, but
there was not much about it to catch and hold his interest.</p>
<p>Almost invariably Keith turned his head in the other direction
the moment he had poked it out of the window and been pulled back
by his mother to a position of greater safety. There, at the foot
of the lane, only a stone's throw distant, opened the stony expanse
of the quay across which surged a veritable multitude of men and
animals and vehicles at all hours of the day. At the end of the
Quay, silhouetted against blue or grey or green water, appeared
commonly the blunt nose or the flag-draped stern of a big steamer,
but hardly ever the middle part of a hull with bridge or masts. And
Keith could never recall whether the complete shape of a full-sized
vessel was finally revealed to him by reality or by that reflection
of it which, at an uncannily premature age, he began to find in
books.</p>
<p>The main feature of the view, however--a sort of narrow Japanese
panel where childish eyes perceived everything as on a flat
surface--was that it continued upwards: first, a lot of water,
ripped and curled by busily scurrying steam launches and tugs,
streaked by plodding rowboats, and, at rare times, adorned by a
white-sailed yacht; then, still higher up, a shore with many trees
that drew the soul magnetically by their summer verdure; and,
finally, a brightly red, toylike fort, crowned by a small embattled
tower flying the blue and yellow Swedish flag at the top. Here was
another world, indeed, larger and brighter by far, and more richly
varied, than that of his home and the lane below and the dingy
courtyard in the back.</p>
<p>So he began to ask questions, and one of the first things he
learned, to his great astonishment, was that he had not always
lived in the same place--that he had been born, whatever that
meant, in another and unmistakably more desirable part of the
city.</p>
<p>"But why did we come here," he asked, trying instinctively to
keep his voice from sounding regretful or petulant.</p>
<p>"Because the bank owns this house," his mother replied. "And
because papa acts as landlord for it, and we don't have to pay any
rent here."</p>
<p>Out of this confusing answer he retained a single idea: the
bank. It was in the home air, so to speak. Evidently his father was
closely connected with it, and this was good for the whole family.
For a little while the boy imagined that his father was the bank.
Later he began to think of it as some sort of superlatively
powerful being that, alone in the whole world, ranked above his
father even. Still later--much later--he began to suspect a
relationship between the bank and his father resembling that
between his father and himself. And he read out of his father's
words and miens a sense of dissatisfaction not unlike the one he
felt when he was forced to do what he did not want, or prevented
from doing what he wanted.</p>
<p>This was his fourth fundamental realization: of powers beyond
those directly represented within the home; powers of compelling
importance that might, or might not, be kindly; powers before which
all and everything within his own narrow world had to bow down in
helpless submission. In the end this one undoubtedly became the
most significant of all his early realizations. It tended gradually
to lessen his awe of parental authority so that, at a very early
age, he developed the courage to shape his own life and opinions
regardless of his immediate surroundings. At the same time, strange
as it may seem, it inspired him with a general respect for
established authority from which he could never quite free
himself.</p>

<h2><a name="I_II"></a>II</h2>
<br>
<p>"Why don't I remember when we came here," Keith asked his mother
one day after she had let out the startling fact of his being born
elsewhere.</p>
<p>"Because it happened before you began to remember things," she
said a little warily.</p>
<p>As frequently was the case, her reply puzzled him more than the
fact it was meant to explain, and so he asked no more questions
that time.</p>
<p>On the whole, he lived completely in the present, and rather on
the edge nearest the future, so that a teacher later said of him
that he was in constant danger of "falling off forward." Highstrung
and restless, sitting still did not come naturally until he had
learned to read books all by himself, and he could hardly be called
introspective. While prone to futile regrets, largely under the
influence of his mother's morbid attitude, he gave little attention
as a rule to what was past and gone.</p>
<p>Here was an exception, however--something concerning the past
that stirred his curiosity powerfully--and it became his first
subject for brooding.</p>
<p>He could remember all sorts of things, of course. And it seemed
that he had always remembered them. Yet his mother was able to tell
him things of which he knew nothing at all, although they had
happened to himself. There might be any number of such things. What
were they? Could he recall any of them by thinking hard enough?</p>
<p>When this problem laid hold of his mind he would retire to the
corner between the big bureau and the right-hand window in the
living-room, which, by formal conferment, was reserved for him as
his own "play-room." The space in that nook was large enough to
hold a small chair, a table to match, and a few toy boxes. There he
would sit staring blindly at his toys until his mother anxiously
inquired what was the matter with him.</p>
<p>The great question taking precedence of all the rest was: what
was the very first thing he could remember?</p>
<p>With puckered brows and peering pupils he would send his gaze
back into the misty past, and out of it emerged invariably the same
image.</p>
<p>He saw himself seated on a small wooden horse fastened to a
little platform with wheels under it. The horse was black with
white spots, and possessed a nobly curved neck, a head with ears on
top of it, and a pair of fiercely red nostrils.</p>
<p>The next thing recurring to his mind was a sense of swift,
exhilarating movement. His father stood at one end of the
living-room, his mother at the other, and the horse with himself on
it was being pushed rapidly back and forth between them.</p>
<p>He could even hear his own joyous shouts as his father sent the
horse careering across the floor by an extra strong push. The
general impression left behind by the whole scene was one of
happiness so acute that nothing else in his life compared with
it.</p>
<p>Was it a real memory? If so, when did it happen? And what had
become of the horse?</p>
<p>Finally the pressure from within became too strong and he
blurted out the whole story to his mother in order to make sure of
what it meant.</p>
<p>"You never had a horse large enough to sit on," she declared
emphatically.</p>
<p>"You have been dreaming, child," Granny put in.</p>
<p>"What would the neighbours below have said," his mother
continued. "And the rag carpets on the floor would have caught the
wheels, anyhow."</p>
<p>Removing the rag carpets except for purposes of cleaning was one
of the unforgivable sins, by the bye.</p>
<p>"And it isn't like your father either," Granny added after a
while, not without a suggestion of bitterness in her voice.</p>
<p>"Carl is always tired when he comes home," Keith's mother
rejoined in a tone that put an end to further discussion.</p>
<p>Granny's point made an impression on Keith's mind nevertheless.
As far as he could actually remember, his father had on no occasion
showed such a jolly spirit or done anything that could be used as
basis for a belief in that one questionable recollection.</p>
<p>At all times of the day Keith was enjoined to keep
quiet--because his mother was not well, or because of the
neighbours, or just because "nice children should not make a
noise"--but it was only after his father's return home that these
injunctions must be taken quite seriously. The father's appearance
brought an instantaneous change in the atmosphere of the place, the
boy strove instinctly to be as little noticeable as possible. If
his mercurial temperament lured him into temporary forgetfulness, a
single stern word from the father sent him back into silence and
the refuge of his own corner--or into bed.</p>
<p>But the more he considered and conceded the unlikeliness of the
scene projected by some part of his mind with such persistency, the
more passionately he craved it to be a real memory of something
that had really happened to himself.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was merely a dream, as Granny had suggested. Perhaps
it was something he had wished....</p>
<p>Anyhow, he did wish that his father would let him come a little
closer to himself at times--not in the same way his mother did, but
as he did in the dream--or whatever it was....</p>
<p>Once more he fell into a deep study of when he had begun to
remember so hard that he could still remember it. Out of this he
was awakened by his mother's voice:</p>
<p>"What <i>is</i> the matter, Keith?"</p>
<p>"I don't know what to play," he replied out of policy, as it
might bring him something either in the way of a diversion or a
treat. There were still some of mother's delectable ginger snaps
left over from the Christmas baking.</p>
<p>"Your soldiers are right in front of you," his mother said in a
voice holding out no hope.</p>
<p>So Keith returned to the tin soldiers that were his most
cherished toys--perhaps because they drew fewer protests from above
than anything else, as being least conductive to outbursts of
youthful vivacity. Judging by the earnest attention with which he
manoeuvred them on his own little table or, in moments of special
dispensation, on the collapsible dining table placed against the
wall between the two windows in the living-room, he ought to have
ended as a general.</p>
<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 35%;">
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="I_III"></a>III</h2>
<br>
<p>All through his life Keith retained a queer inclination to
arrange furniture very precisely at right angles to the wall as
close to it as possible. It was a direct outcome of his first and
most deeply rooted impressions, received in that parental
living-room, where every inch of space had been carefully
calculated, and where the smallest nook was filled by a chair, or a
footstool, or some other minor object. In later years he often
wondered how a single room of modest proportions could hold so much
of furniture and of life.</p>
<p>It was bedroom and study, dining-room and nursery, workroom and
parlour. There the morning toilet was made, and there his first
lessons were learned. There the father did his reading, of which he
was very fond, and there the mother sewed, darned, embroidered,
wrote letters, gave household orders, told fairy tales, and
received visitors. There the simple daily meals were served for all
but Granny, who clung obstinately to the kitchen, and there friends
were feasted and cards played at nameday and birthday parties. And
there three people slept every night.</p>
<p>Of course, excursions could be made, particularly to the kitchen
where Granny was always restlessly waiting for "one more kiss," and
once in a great while to the "best room" which mostly was occupied
by some stranger whose small weekly rent paid the servant's wages.
But to the living-room one always returned in the end, and during
his first years this narrow confinement did not strike Keith as a
hardship.</p>
<p>The room seemed quite large to him at that time, with distances
and vistas and diversions sufficient for his childish fancy. It was
a pleasant room, with brightly striped rag carpets on the floor and
two pretty large windows framed by snow-white lace curtains.
Crammed as it was with objects needed for its many different uses,
it was always kept in a state of the most scrupulous order and
instant disaster followed any attempt as a disarrangement.</p>
<p>It was a whole world by itself, full of interesting things for a
small boy to puzzle over. It was also a world in evolution. Every
so often a piece of furniture would disappear and a better one take
its place, to be studied and admired and tried out again and again.
Back of every improvement lay a unifying ambition. Its key-word was
mahogany. The superior social respectability of this wood could not
be disputed, and it had a sort of natural dignity that harmonized
with the father's solid taste--though the mother might have
preferred something lighter and brighter. And a microcosm of
mahogany might, after all, be worth living for when loftier
illusions had gone on the scrap heap.</p>
<p>Practically everything in the room had a history as well as a
special place. There was the main chest of drawers, for instance,
known as "mamma's bureau" and placed near one of the windows, where
a good light fell on the swinging mirror forming a separate piece
on top of it. A journeyman carpenter had made that chest to prove
himself a master of his trade under the old gild rules. Then he put
it up at lottery to raise money with which to open a shop of his
own. Keith's father bought a lot while still engaged, and won the
prize which became the chief wedding present of his bride--to be
cherished above all other objects to her dying day.</p>
<p>It was really a fine piece of work, of mahogany, with daintily
carved and twisted columns along the front corners, and so highly
polished that Keith could see his own face in the rich brown
glimmer of its surfaces. It had four drawers. The three lower ones
were divided between the parents and held all sorts of things, from
shirts and socks to mother's mahogany yard stick, which had a
turned handle and a tapering blade that made it pass excellent
muster as a sword. The top drawer could only be pulled out halfway,
but then the front of it came down and it changed into a writing
desk, with an intriguing array of small drawers and pigeonholes at
the back of it, and a suspicion of alluring and unattainable
treasures in every separate receptacle. To ransack all of these was
Keith's most audacious dream, but when the dream came true at last,
it was fraught with no ecstasy of realization, for he was a
middle-aged man, and in the room behind him his mother lay
dead....</p>
<p>The mirror was flanked by two small square mahogany boxes, one
holding medicines and the other tobacco. Little mats, some
crocheted and some wonderfully composed of differently coloured
glass beads, were used to protect the boxes as well as the top of
the bureau from being scratched, and on them stood several small
groups and figures of porcelain. One of these was Keith's special
favourite and his first introduction to that world where beauty
takes precedence of goodness and truth. It showed a lady and a
gentleman in dresses of a colour and cut wholly unlike anything
seen by Keith on the real persons coming within his ken. They were
seated on a richly ornamented sofa before a tea table, and there
was something about the manner in which they looked at each other
that spoke more loudly than their bright costumes of things lying
beyond ordinary existence.</p>
<p>There was also a nice little girl with a doll viewing herself
complacently in a real mirror, and a lady in bloomers, apparently
of Oriental pattern, who rowed a boat hardly larger than herself,
that was raised almost on end by terrific waves. All three groups
had this in common, that when you removed the ornamental upper
part, a previously unsuspected inkstand was revealed. There was a
period when Keith seriously believed that all specimens of the
keramic art were inkstands in disguise.</p>
<p>Art not represented on the bureau alone, however. The walls
contained a number of steel engravings in gilt frames, quaint old
coloured prints, family photographs, and pink-coloured reliefs of
various Swedish kings made out of wax and mounted under convex
glass panes on highly polished black boards. But all of those
objects were flat and distant and colourless in comparison with the
things on the bureau that could be touched as well as seen. As for
the group with the lady and the gentlemen, it had only one rival in
the boy's mind, and that was the big clock in a wooden case that
hung on the wall between the windows over the dining table. The
hide-and-seek of the restless pendulum with its shining brass disc
was a constant source of fascination in itself, and so were the
strange operations performed by the father in front of the clock
every Sunday morning, when diversions were particularly welcome on
account of the extra restrictions on play. But its main charm
rested in the strangely pleasing sounds it produced every so often,
preceded by a funny rattle that warned small folk and big of what
was going to happen. It was Keith's first acquaintance with
music.</p>
<p>The parents' bed occupied the centre of the right-hand wall,
between mamma's bureau and another chest of drawers known as
"Granny's bureau." It was all wood and made in two parts that slid
into each other, reducing the daytime width of the bed by one-half.
It stood parallel to the wall, instead of at right angles, and the
extension took place sideways. At night it looked like an ordinary
double bed. In the day it almost disappeared beneath a rectangular
pile of bed-clothing, covered by a snow-white spread that was
pulled and smoothed and tucked until it hung straight as a
wall.</p>
<p>Granny's bureau, old-fashioned and clumsy, but made of some
native wood that glimmered like gold, was largely devoted to linen
ware for bed and table. At the top it had two small drawers instead
of a long, and one of these constituted the first storage place set
aside for Keith's special use. His impression was that it had
always been his, and once he asked his mother if it really had been
his before he was born.</p>
<p>"Of course it was," she said with a sly smile, "but we took the
liberty to use it for other purposes until you arrived"</p>
<p>At first glance this seemed quite reasonable to Keith, though
nothing to smile at so far as he could see. Later he became
conscious of a vague sense of annoyance. It would have been more
pleasant if no one else had ever used that drawer.</p>
<p>Across the room from Granny's bureau, in the corner just inside
the door to the kitchen, towered the characteristic Swedish oven--a
round column of white glazed bricks, with highly polished brass
shutters in front of the small cubical fire-place, where nothing
but birchwood was burned. In the narrow crack between the oven and
the wall rested always a birch rod, which was often referred to at
critical moments. A new rod, with brightly coloured feathers
attached to the tip of every twig, appeared regularly on Shrove
Tuesday and tended slightly to spoil that otherwise glorious day,
when large cross buns stuffed with a mixture of crushed almond and
sugar were served in hot milk for dinner. Though the rod was little
more than a symbol of family discipline, Keith always disliked its
presence as a threat to his dignity if not to his hide.</p>
<p>A double washstand, looking like a document chest in the
daytime, the chaiselongue on which Keith slept at night, and the
door to the best room occupied all the rest of that wall except a
corner by the window, where stood his mother's high-backed easy
chair, with the little work-table beside it and a hassock in front
of it. To that chair she would retire whenever her household duties
permitted, and thither Keith would be drawn even more powerfully
than to his own "play-room" at the opposite corner--especially when
his mother seemed in a happy mood. There he would kneel on the
hassock, with his head in her lap, and if he could think of nothing
else, he would say:</p>
<p>"Tell me about the time you were in London."</p>
<br>
<br>

<h2><a name="I_IV"></a>IV</h2>
<br>
<p>While still in her early twenties, Keith's mother had spent two
years with an English family living in Sweden. She always described
her position as that of "lady companion" to the mistress of the
house. As a little boy, Keith did not know enough to ask any
embarrassing questions. Having learned more of life, he began to
suspect that his mother's place might have been little better than
that of a servant, and the thought of it made his soul shrink and
wither.</p>
<p>When the family moved back to England, Keith's mother went along
and spent a whole year in London. It was her great adventure, the
phase of her past of which she spoke most eagerly and lovingly. She
had formed a passionate liking for the English language, of which
she had picked up a good deal, as well as for English character and
English manners. She never tired of telling about the great city of
London, and Keith never tired of listening.</p>
<p>"I was so homesick when I first got there," she would say, "that
I cried day and night. Then, one night, I heard a cat mewing on the
roof outside my window. It was the first Swedish sound I had heard
since I came to England, and after that I felt much better."</p>
<p>"Why didn't you stay," asked Keith.</p>
<p>"Because then there would have been no little Keith," she
explained, her face lighting up with the kind of grown-up smile
that always provoked and perplexed the boy.</p>
<p>"Are there no boys in England," he persisted.</p>
<p>"Yes, plenty of them, and fine ones at that. But I wanted no one
but you, and you were here, and so I had to come back to get
you."</p>
<p>"Here," he repeated. "Where here?"</p>
<p>"In Sweden, of course," his mother rejoined, and then she
started hurriedly to describe the wonders of London shopping.</p>
<p>"But why did you go at all," he interrupted after listening a
while to what seemed less interesting to him than certain other
points. "I might have been lost while you were away."</p>
<p>"You might," she assented, "but I had to take the risk because I
had to get a name for you and I could never have found the one you
have in Sweden."</p>
<p>"Why not?"</p>
<p>"Because it is English. And it should be pronounced <i>Keeth</i>
instead of <i>Kite</i> as they say here. I found it in a book over
there, and I fell in love with it the moment I saw it, and I made
up my mind that if I ever had a boy, that would be his name."</p>
<p>"<i>If</i> you had a boy," Keith took her up. "But you knew I
was here?"</p>
<p>"Of course, I knew," said his mother in the tone that always
warned him that a change of occupation would be in order. "Run
along and play in your own corner now. I must get some work
done."</p>
<p>At other times, when the talk didn't drift off into dangerous
by-paths, his mother would tell little anecdotes in English learned
from her former mistress, and generally end up by singing a little
song about a ball--probably one that had something to do with
cricket. And Keith would exultantly repeat the last line, which was
the only one he could remember:</p>
<p>"And then she <i>popped</i>, and then she died."</p>
<p>It was the word <i>popped</i> that caught his fancy, partly
because it was so funny in itself, and partly because it had to be
uttered with a sort of explosion on a very high note. As far as his
rendering of the rest was concerned--well, it was early discovered
and reluctantly admitted that, like his father, he could not even
sing "Old Man Noah," which is the simplest melody imaginable to a
musical mind in Sweden.</p>
<p>His failure in this respect gave his mother a slight pang every
time it was brought home to her, although she made fun of it and
pretended she didn't care. Music had been her young heart's dream.
It was the only art for which she showed a genuine regard. And two
of her pet grievances were that she didn't have a piano, and that,
if she had one, she could not play on it.</p>
<p>But his father used to say that the only instrument he cared to
hear was a drum.</p>
<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 35%;">
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="I_V"></a>V</h2>
<br>
<p>His mother's chief grievance was her health. She was rarely
quite well, and they had a family physician who would appear from
time to time without being sent for. Yet her illness seemed, as a
rule, not to prevent her from being about and attending to her
household duties.</p>
<p>Once, however, while Keith was still too small to receive clear
impressions, she had to keep in bed for a long time and during much
of that time she seemed to have forgotten him entirely. The father
was more taciturn and reserved than usual, and even the boy could
see that he was worried. Friends and relatives came and went with a
quite uncommon frequency, and all of them spoke to Keith in a
strange manner that, although not unpleasant, had a tendency to
make him choke. A hundred times a day he was told that he must keep
quiet for his mother's sake, and that it was no time for boisterous
playing--if he really must play at all. Most of the time he was in
the kitchen, and on a few occasions he was even permitted to stay
all by himself in the parlour, where there were all sorts of big
books with any number of pictures on the fine oval table standing
in front of an old sofa so huge that to crawl up on its seat was
almost like going off into another room.</p>
<p>Finally he was taken to the home of Aunt Brita, his father's
married sister, in another part of the town and kept there, a
bewildered prisoner in a strange land, until one day his aunt told
him that his mother was well and wanted him to come home, but that
he would have to be a more than usually good boy for a long time
yet, unless he wanted to lose his mother forever.</p>
<p>When, at last, he was home again, his mother pulled him up to
herself in the bed, embraced him passionately and sobbed as if it
had been a farewell instead of a greeting. He wept, too, and clung
to his mother as if in fright, while she told him that he must
always do just what she told him and, above all, not scare her by
going off so that she did not know where he was.</p>
<p>The father stood beside the bed watching them. And as Keith
happened to look up once, he saw that his father's eyes were moist
with tears. The boy could hardly believe it, and a little later he
wondered whether he had been mistaken, for his father spoke just
then in his sternest tone, and all he said was:</p>
<p>"Yes, I hope you will behave a little better after this than you
have done before."</p>
<p>Many more weeks went before his mother was herself again. Even
then a difference remained. She was more given to worry than before
and clung to husband and child with a concern that frequently
became oppressive.</p>
<p>Then, one fine day, she was all gay and smiling again, and
bustled about the home with new eagerness, and told Keith a lot of
things about England, and once actually danced across the floor
while he was vainly trying to keep step with her. And the father
tried hard to look his grouchiest when he returned home that night,
but failed. And Keith was allowed to stay up quite late, and when
he was in bed at last, and almost asleep, he thought he saw his
father in the big easy chair by the window, with the mother seated
on his lap kissing him. And just as he was dropping off, he heard,
as if in a dream, his father's voice saying:</p>
<p>"Look out! I think the Crown Prince is still awake!"</p>
<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 35%;">
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="I_VI"></a>VI</h2>
<p>Some persons said that Keith looked like his father, others that
he was the very image of his mother.</p>
<p>"He has my light hair and Carl's brown eyes," said his mother
often when that topic was under discussion, and saying it seemed to
make her happy.</p>
<p>"As a baby he was so pretty that people would stop us on the
street to ask whose child he was," Granny might put in, if she
happened to be within hearing. Then she would add with a glance at
Keith: "But that is all gone now."</p>
<p>Keith himself never gave much thought to his looks, but any
comparison with his mother struck him as quite foolish.</p>
<p>He liked to look at her, especially at her hair, which was very
plentiful and in colour like beaten copper with glints of gold in
it. Her skin was very fair and soft as the softest velvet. Her eyes
were blue, and in bright moments they had the softness of the sky
of a Swedish summer night. But when the clouds of depression closed
in upon her, they grew pale and light less and disturbingly
furtive, so that Keith's glance found it hard to meet them.</p>
<p>Her gaiety sparkled when she was herself, and she had a
passionate love of everything that was bright and pleasant. Once
she had always been that way and at times she would tell Keith what
a wonderful time she had as a girl, and how she used to be the
centre and inspiration of every social gathering in which she took
part. She had a quick mind, too, and a heart full of impulsive
generosity. But from one extreme she would go to another, so that,
when the dark moments came, she would even regret kindnesses
conferred while the sun was still shining. In such moments she
would sometimes speak to the boy of her ailment as if he were in
some mysterious way responsible for it.</p>
<p>Yet she loved the boy to distraction and became filled with
unreasoning anxiety the moment he was out of sight. Her attitude
toward her husband was the same. He could never leave the home or
return to it without being kissed. The moment he was outside the
kitchen door, she hastened to the window and leaned out of it so
that she might watch him until he vanished about the corner at the
head of the lane. And there she generally lay waiting for him when
he came home. If he was late, which happened almost every day, she
would be the victim of a thousand fears as she made more and more
frequent trips between the kitchen and the living-room window. When
he finally came, she acted as if she had not seen him for months
while he pretended to be more or less bored by her attentions.</p>
<p>But there were moments, too, when her tenderness flared into
startling outbursts of bleak, cutting anger, giving way in the end
to floods of hysterical tears. A couple of such tempests formed
part of Keith's earliest reliable memories.</p>
<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 35%;">
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="I_VII"></a>VII</h2>
<br>
<p>As a rule Keith slept far too soundly to be aroused by anything.
One night, however, there was so much loud talking in the room that
he woke up completely. For a while he lay quite still, but with
wide-open eyes and ears.</p>
<p>The big lamp had been placed on the washstand back of the
chaiselongue on which he was lying, evidently in order to prevent
its light from falling on his face.</p>
<p>His mother was seated, fully dressed, on the edge of the bed
across the room. Her face was white as snow. Her eyes blazed with a
sort of cold fire. Her whole body seemed to tremble with a feeling
so tense that he could not find words for it.</p>
<p>The father was leaning far backwards on an ordinary chair, with
his outstretched right arm resting on the dining table. His face
was flushed and the thick fringe of black hair about the bald top
of his head was slightly disordered. He tried to smile, but the
smile turned into a grin. When he spoke, his voice was a little
thick.</p>
<p>"I can't keep entirely away from my comrades." he said. "They
think already that I am too stuck up to associate with them. I
haven't been out for two weeks. I haven't had a drop more tonight
than I can stand. And it isn't twelve o'clock yet."</p>
<p>All of a sudden Keith saw the cold, angry light go out of his
mother's eyes. Her face twisted convulsively. She sank into a heap
on the bed, sobbing as if her heart would break then and there.</p>
<p>"Carl," she screamed between two sobs. "You'll kill me if you
talk like that to me!"</p>
<p>"Like that," he repeated in a stunned toneless voice. Then his
face flushed almost purple. A hard look came into his eyes, and he
rose so abruptly that the chair upset behind him. At the same time
he brought down his fist with such violence that the table nearly
toppled over.</p>
<p>"I'll be damned if I stand this kind of thing one moment
longer," he shouted hoarsely.</p>
<p>But even as he spoke, his eyes fell on the boy. As if by magic,
his self-control returned.</p>
<p>"The boy is awake," he said in his usual tone of stern
reserve.</p>
<p>There was a moment's silence. A few more sobs came from the
mother. Then she sat up, wiped her eyes, and spoke in a tone that
was almost calm:</p>
<p>"Go to sleep again, Keith. Your father and I were merely talking
about some things that you don't understand yet."</p>
<p>When she saw that the boy was crying, she came over to him,
kneeled down beside him and put her arms about him. Soon her kisses
and her soothing words had their wonted effect, and he dropped off
once more into the deep, deathlike slumber of childhood.</p>
<p>The air remained tense in the household for several days, but
nothing further happened until one night when the father arrived a
little later than usual from his work, looking just as he did the
night of the quarrel. Again his speech was a little thick, and the
mother's face assumed an ominous look. She said nothing about what
was nearest her heart, however, she started instead to complain of
some petty disobedience on the part of Keith.</p>
<p>"If you spanked him a little more and humoured him la little
less, he would obey more readily," said the father.</p>
<p>His words carried no particular menace, and there seemed no
reason why the boy should be scared. But perhaps there was
something else in the atmosphere that affected his sensitive nerves
and sent him unexpectedly into a paroxysm of weeping.</p>
<p>"Stop it," cried his father dark with sudden anger. "Stop it, I
tell you."</p>
<p>"You leave the boy alone," cried the mother, her face as white
as the father's was red.</p>
<p>"We'll see whether he'll obey or not!"</p>
<p>As he spoke, the father sat down on the nearest chair, picked up
the boy and put him face down across his knees.</p>
<p>Keith's heart seemed to stop. He even ceased weeping. Then he
heard his mother cry out:</p>
<p>"If you touch the boy, I'll throw myself out of the window!"</p>
<p>"Oh, hell!" came back from the father. With that he half dropped
and half flung the boy to the floor, so that the latter rolled
across the room and landed under the chaiselongue.</p>
<p>There Keith lay, still as a mouse, until he was pulled out by
his mother. He didn't begin to cry again, and he was no longer
scared or upset. A few moments later he was undressing and going to
bed as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>Another week had hardly passed, when Keith was waked up again at
night, but this time by a noise as if the house was falling. As he
sat up in bed, staring wildly about him, his nostrils became filled
with a smell that was quite new to him. It was like smoke, but more
pungent.</p>
<p>The living-room was dark, but the door to the parlour stood
open, and light came through it. Not a sound could be heard for a
few moments.</p>
<p>Then his mother came running into the room and flung herself on
her knees beside the chaiselongue.</p>
<p>"Oh, my boy, my boy, my boy!" she cried over and over again as
she pressed Keith to her breast, rocking him back and forth.</p>
<p>A few seconds later the father also came in carrying the lamp in
one hand. Having put it on the dining table, he dropped down on a
chair as if too exhausted to stand up.</p>
<p>His face showed a pallor quite strange to it and for the first
and only time in his life Keith thought that his father looked
scared.</p>
<p>"Don't, Anna," the father said after a while, sitting up
straight on the chair. "It's all right now--"</p>
<p>Then a thought or a memory seemed to recur to him, and he said
in a voice that nearly broke:</p>
<p>"God, but it was a close call for both of us! And if it had
happened to you, I would have followed you on the spot!"</p>
<p>"Carl, Carl!" cried the mother, letting Keith go and throwing
her arms about her husband instead. "What would have become of
Keith?"</p>
<p>It was the first time the boy was taken into his parents'
confidence to some extent. He was still too young to grasp all the
implications, but the main facts were plain enough even to him.</p>
<p>The parlour was rented as usual, but the man occupying it was
not at home. The parents had gone in there together on some errand.
Seeing a small pistol hanging on the wall above the big sofa, the
father took it down and began to play with it, never for a moment
suspecting it of being loaded.</p>
<p>First he pointed it at himself, then at Keith's mother. Each
time he was about to pull the trigger, and each time something
seemed to hold him back. Finally he turned the weapon toward the
wall and pressed down with his finger. As he did so, the shot rang
out that waked the boy.</p>
<p>The next day Keith was permitted to examine the mark made by the
bullet in the wall. It was all very exciting. But the final result
of that incident was as unforeseen as the shot itself.</p>
<p>The whole affair evidently made a deep impression on Keith's
father. He ceased almost completely to go out by himself at night.
In fact he became so averse to leaving his home that it was hard to
get him out when the mother wanted him to go. And never again did
Keith hear his parents quarrel openly.</p>
<p>But now and then when his father came home from work, Keith
would notice that same slight thickness of speech which had forced
itself on his attention on two extraordinary occasions.</p>
<p>He was a man himself before he realized what that thickness
signified in his father's life.</p>
<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 35%;">

<h2><a name="I_VIII"></a>VIII</h2>
<br>
<p>"Oh, mamma, you mustn't!" cried Keith's mother one day when she
came out into the kitchen and found the boy munching a slice of
white bread with butter on it.</p>
<p>"He likes it so much," replied Granny easily.</p>
<p>"But you know what Carl has said," the mother rejoined rather
impatiently. "He'll find out sooner or later if you disregard it,
and then he'll be furious."</p>
<p>"So he will anyhow," muttered Granny.</p>
<p>"Mamma!" protested the mother. "It's for the boy's own good. He
should only eat hard bread except on Sundays and when we have
company. It is much better for his teeth. And it makes him stronger
too. You want to be big and strong, don't you Keith?"</p>
<p>"It's a wonder his father lets him have anything at all to eat,"
Granny put in before Keith had a chance to answer.</p>
<p>"You must not talk like that, mamma," said the mother sharply.
"Least of all when the boy hears it." Then she turned to Keith
again: "Don't you believe what Granny says. Your father is merely
thinking of what is good for you. He loves you just as much as I
do--or your grandmother. But he thinks we are spoiling you. And he
wants you to grow up and be a real man. That's why he hates to see
you cry."</p>
<p>There was a pause while Keith pondered the matter--not seriously
concerned on the whole, as long as the tidbit was not taken away
from him.</p>
<p>"Don't you love your father," his mother asked suddenly.</p>
<p>"Ye-es," Keith answered mechanically.</p>
<p>Then he began to ponder again. His feelings toward his father
were far too complicated for utterance. They seemed to have nothing
whatsoever to do with love, if that was what he felt for his
mother. There was undoubtedly a great deal of fear in his attitude
toward the father, and also resentment that at times would flare
into something bordering on hatred. But this attitude was combined
with a lot of respect, not to say admiration. At times it would
also be tinged with a longing that he could not explain or express.
And if ever the father gave him the slightest evidence of
friendliness, he would be thrown into a rapture of happiness that
nothing done by his mother could equal.</p>
<p>He adored his mother, and clung to her, and relied on her and
wheedled her, but it was an open question whether, at heart, he
felt any particular respect for her--although he was quite proud of
certain things about her. And as for Granny, whom, in a way, he
loved more than anybody else, because she petted him and indulged
his slightest whims, there could simply be no talk about respecting
her. Even Keith realized that she was not in the respected
class.</p>
<p>His father was, on the other hand. There could be no doubt about
that. If he had only been willing to unbend a little now and
then....</p>
<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 35%;">
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="I_IX"></a>IX</h2>
<br>
<p>The kitchen had other attractions than Granny, though she ranked
foremost.</p>
<p>As Keith came out from the living-room, he had on his right the
huge, old-fashioned fire-place--a regular fortress of brick, with a
modern cook stove of iron set into one corner of it. It was
entirely covered by a smoke-hood of painted metal sheeting, with a
flange on its outside edge along which were placed a number of
lids.</p>
<p>On his left was a set of shelves filled from top to bottom with
pots and pans and kettles of every possible size and shape,
including a cauldron so huge and heavy that it took two people to
get it out with ease from its place on the bottom shelf. An
overwhelming majority of these utensils were of copper and so
highly polished that they shone like suns setting through a fog
bank. Some of them made good toys, but "things for use and not for
play" was an old maxim often quoted by both parents and grudgingly
repeated by Granny herself.</p>
<p>A big sofa, in which the grandmother slept at night stood along
the centre of the wall on the left. The corner beyond held a
wall-fast cupboard so large that it looked like a closet built into
the room. It serves both as pantry and buffet, and was full of
things tempting to a young palate.</p>
<p>In the opposite corner, beyond the window and right by the
outside door, stood an open water barrel holding about twenty
gallons. There was no running water above the ground floor. Every
drop had to be carried three flights of stairs from the courtyard.
What was needed for drinking and cooking was kept in a copper can,
two feet high, with a lid on top and a spout in front that made it
look like a badly overgrown tea kettle. Water for all other uses
had to come out of the barrel. To keep both vessels filled was a
heavy task, and waste of water was regarded as little short of a
crime. The sacredness of the barrel and its contents was a mystery
to Keith until he grew old enough to do some of the carrying. Then
he began to understand.</p>
<p>Most of the water went to the stove, where operations of one
kind or another were carried on from morning till night, tempting
the boy with their mysteries or their promises. In the uppermost
corner of the hood was a square opening covered by an iron lid.
When the lid was down and you crawled right up into the fire-place,
you could see the sky through the chimney.</p>
<p>One day, when Keith had sneaked into the kitchen uninvited, he
noticed something unusual going on in the fire-place. All the
paraphernalia had been cleared away. The lid was open, and from the
chimney issued strange noises. Then soot began to fall in masses,
and finally appeared a pair of human feet, quite bare and all
black.</p>
<p>It was very funny and very disconcerting. Keith watched with
bulging eyes and trembling heart, until at last a whole big man
came out of the chimney. As he crouched for a moment on the
fire-place before getting down on the floor, he turned on Keith a
pair of eyes that seemed to be all white and big as moons.</p>
<p>At that moment fear got the better of curiosity, and Keith made
haste to bury his face in Granny's lap.</p>
<p>"Yes, Keith had better look out," grinned the servant girl, "for
the chimney sweep takes all bad little boys."</p>
<p>"I'll take you, if you talk like that," the black figure in the
fire-place shot back at her.</p>
<p>The tone of his voice made Keith steal another glance at him.
The white eyes shone right at him in a rather friendly fashion, and
further down a huge red slit in the black face framed two rows of
teeth no less white than the eyes. Keith guessed that the dark
visitor from the chimney was smiling at him in a fashion that
seemed to bode no harm.</p>
<p>In another minute the man was gone, and Keith hurried back to
the living-room to ask a question of his mother:</p>
<p>"Could he really take me?"</p>
<p>"Not unless we gave him leave," she replied. "But sometimes,
when little boys are very, <i>very</i> bad, their parents turn them
over to the sweep as apprentices, because they are not good for
anything else."</p>
<p>Keith thought long and hard.</p>
<p>"I ain't bad," he declared at last.</p>
<p>"Not exactly," his mother remarked diplomatically "But you could
be a great deal better. What were you doing in the kitchen just
now? I have told you not to run out there all the time. Lena does
not like you to get in her way, you know."</p>
<p>"But Granny is there," Keith protested.</p>
<p>"Yes, of course, and you must be nice to her, but...."</p>
<p>As his mother did not go on, Keith asked: "Why does Granny
always stay in the kitchen?"</p>
<p>"Because she wants to," his mother answered.</p>
<p>"But why does she want to?"</p>
<p>"It is her way--a sort of pride she has. And I have long ago
given up trying to persuade her."</p>
<p>Her tone indicated clearly that further discussion of the
subject was not desirable.</p>

<br>
<p>Keith was playing in his own corner that very evening, trying to
keep as quiet as possible while his father had an unusually late
dinner. His mother had gone out into the kitchen a few moments
earlier. Thence she returned suddenly with a half empty bottle in
her hand and a look of extreme annoyance on her face.</p>
<p>"Carl," she said, "look what I just found in a corner of the
cupboard."</p>
<p>"Humph," the father grunted with a sideglance at the bottle.
"Ours is locked up, is it not?"</p>
<p>"Yes, but that is neither here nor there. She would rather die,
she says, than touch a drop of ours."</p>
<p>"Where does she get it?"</p>
<p>"I can't make it out. Somebody must bring it in, of course. I
fear it is Mrs. Karlgren, and I am simply going to tell her to keep
away hereafter. The idea of her coming here practically begging,
and then doing such a thing, after all I have done for her!"</p>
<p>"But you are not sure," the father objected earnestly, and Keith
paid special notice to his objection because he had already
learned, or divined, that his father could not bear the sight of
the poor woman in question.</p>
<p>"No, it is impossible to be sure," the mother admitted. Then she
added after a pause: "What puzzles me more than anything else is
where she gets the money."</p>
<p>Though no name was mentioned, Keith knew perfectly well that
they were speaking of Granny. And he recalled having laughed at her
in the kitchen earlier in the evening before the father came home.
Her eyes had a funny look and seemed a little inflamed. Her still
thick braids were loosened and about to come entirely undone. She
was talking more than usual and in a tone that suggested
defiance.</p>
<p>As he recalled all this, Keith forgot to listen to his parents,
who went on discussing so intently that he was able to leave his
corner and reach the door to the kitchen unnoticed. An irresistible
desire to see Granny at once had seized him. Back of it lay a
vaguely sensed mixture of curiosity and sympathy.</p>
<p>Granny was in her favourite place beside the kitchen sofa,
seated on a footstool almost as large as an ordinary chair, but
somewhat lower. That stool was the one bone of contention between
her and Keith, because he was carrying it off as often as he could
get at it. Turned upside down, with Keith seated snugly between its
four legs, it became a sleigh drawn across icy plains by a team of
swift reindeer, or a ship rocking mightily on the high seas.</p>
<p>The kitchen was full of a peculiar sweetish smell, by which
Keith knew without looking that Granny was dressing the old wound
on her left leg that had developed "the rose" and would not heal.
She was leaning far over, busy with a bandage which she wound
tightly about her leg, from the ankle to the knee. The boy sniffed
the familiar smell with a vague sense of discomfort, which,
however, did not prevent him from going up to the grandmother and
putting one arm about her neck.</p>
<p>"Old hurt is hard to mend," she muttered quoting one of the old
saws always on her lips. Then without raising her head, she added
in the peevish, truculent tone of a thwarted child: "You had better
go back in there before they come and get you. I am nothing but a
servant, and as such I know my place and keep it. I am less than a
servant, for they wouldn't dare do to Lena what they do to me."</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, they would," Lena put in from across the room. "And
they would have a right, too."</p>
<p>As if she had not heard at all, Granny sat up straight and
looked hard at the boy.</p>
<p>"Whatever you do, Keith," she said, and he noticed that her
voice sounded a little strange, "see that you make a lot of money
when you grow up. To be poor is to have no rights, and the worst
thing of all is to be dependent on others, no matter how near they
are to you."</p>
<p>"I think Mrs. Carlsson is very ungrateful," said Lena. "There
are thousands of old people who would give anything to have a nice
home and nothing to worry over."</p>
<p>"Anybody can talk, but it takes a head to keep silent," said
Granny impersonally, quoting another old saw. Then her manner
changed abruptly and she turned to Keith effusively.</p>
<p>"Give me a kiss! You love your old Granny, don't you? You don't
despise her, do you, because she has nothing and is nothing? And
can be sure she loves you more than anybody else."</p>
<p>The boy's feelings were so mixed that he really could not feel
anything at all. His arm was still about the grandmother's neck,
mechanically he gave her the kiss she asked for, but it was with
real relief he saw his mother open the door to the living-room and
responded to her demand that he go to bed at once.</p>

<h2><a name="I_XI"></a>XI</h2>
<br>
<p>Hardly any memory left behind by Keith's childhood was more
acute than the image of Granny seated in the centre of the kitchen,
her stolid, yet pleasant old face bent over some household task,
and her whole figure instinct with a passive protest against her
enforced dependency or, maybe against life's arbitrariness in
general. One moment she seemed to be brooding deeply, and the next
she looked as if there was not a thought in her head. For one
reason or another, her anomalous position and peculiar attitude
occupied Keith's mind a great deal, and many of the questions with
which he plied his mother were concerned with Granny. They were
fairly discreet as a rule, but on the morning after the scene just
described, some impulse of which he had no clear understanding made
him perplex his mother with the abrupt question:</p>
<p>"Why does Granny drink?"</p>
<p>They were alone in the living-room at the time, she seated in
her big easy chair by the window and he, as usual, kneeling on the
hassock at her feet.</p>
<p>She looked up at him with as much surprise as if he had hit her
viciously. A deeper red flowed into her cheeks that kept their soft
pinkness even when she was thought at death's door and lost it only
under the pressure of extreme anger.</p>
<p>At the same time a look came into her eyes that gave Keith a
momentary scare. It was only a flash, however, and changed quickly
into something like the helplessness that used to characterize her
glance in moments of heavy depression. Her voice trembled a little
as she spoke:</p>
<p>"Because Granny's life has been very hard, and not very
happy."</p>
<p>"Tell me about it," urged the boy.</p>
<p>There was a long pause during which he watched his mother's face
closely. Gradually its expression changed into one of resignation,
and then into determination, as if she had made up her mind to be
done once for all with a task that could not be avoided
indefinitely. It was a long story she told, at first hesitatingly,
then with an eagerness that betrayed an awakening purpose.
Everything she said stuck deeply in the boy's mind, and whenever he
thought of Granny's life afterwards, he had the impression of
having learned all about it at that one time, although the
likelihood is that many details were picked up by degrees and
dovetailed into the memory of that first narrative as integral
parts of it.</p>
<p>"Your grandmother was not born to be a servant," his mother
began. "She was a rich man's daughter, and there was not a thing
her father didn't want to do for her. Yet he left her in the hands
of strangers who cheated her of her rights and treated her as if
she had been a beggar...."</p>
<p>"Why did they do it," the boy asked, quite unable to grasp the
idea of such a thing.</p>
<p>"Because they could make a little more money that way, and
because they cared for nothing but money. Promise me, Keith, that
whatever happens to you, and whatever the temptation be, you will
never put money above everything else."</p>
<p>Keith shook his head earnestly, meaning it to be sign of assent.
He was a highly impressible child, and when his mother spoke to him
like that, he used literally to choke with a feeling that he could
never, never do anything but what she asked, but when another rush
of feeling swept over him, the old promises were also likely to be
swept out of his mind.</p>
<p>"Those people did the worst thing any one can do to anybody
else. They twisted Granny's life so that it could never be set
right again. And so she became what you see her now...."</p>
<p>"You mean she just couldn't help herself," Keith put in.</p>
<p>"Yes, that's what I mean," she agreed. Then she stopped as if
struck by another thought, and said very slowly:</p>
<p>"Although, if she had been really strong...."</p>
<p>Once more she stopped and returned abruptly to her story:</p>
<p>"Your great-grandfather made and sold hats, and he earned a lot
of money, and they made him a City Councillor...."</p>
<p>"Where," Keith broke in again.</p>
<p>"In Skara," his mother explained, "which is a city that lies a
long way from here, and when you begin to learn geography, you will
know where it is.... Everybody liked your
great-grandfather...."</p>
<p>"What was his name," Keith couldn't help asking.</p>
<p>"Lack," she said, "and now you mustn't interrupt me any more if
you want me to go on."</p>
<p>"Please," Keith pleaded. "I won't!"</p>
<p>"The reason they liked him," she resumed, "was that he was so
good-hearted that he couldn't say no to anybody or anything. He
didn't seem to care for money at all, and he used to say: 'What's
money between friends?' Everybody wanted to be friends with him in
those days, and everybody borrowed from him, until he didn't have
enough left for his business, and then they laughed at him. He
tried in his turn to borrow, but no one could spare a penny, and
when things went entirely wrong with him, one of those who had got
most from him made a funny saying about him: 'Now Lack lacks
everything because everybody has what Lack lacks.' So, you see, you
mustn't think too little of money either, but learn to be careful
and keep what you have."</p>
<p>Keith nodded dutifully, but where the right road lay, he could
not see.</p>
<p>"The worst thing was," the mother went on, "that your
great-grandmother died when Granny was only nine. There were
brothers and sisters, too, and she was the youngest. And it was
then that her father got the idea to send her to some farmer people
he knew, quite some distance from where he lived. He did it partly
for the sake of Granny's health, and partly because he was too
worried about other things to look after her properly himself. And
he paid a lot of money for her board, and sent her fine clothes,
and arranged that she was to be taught by the pastor of the parish,
and he sent friends to ask about her, but he never came himself.
The people who were to take care of Granny kept the money and the
clothes, and put her to work as if she had been a servant, and
didn't let her get the least bit of schooling. And when her
father's friends came and asked about her, they told all sorts of
tales about how well she was doing, but she was so shy, they said,
that she always ran away when any visitor came to the place."</p>
<p>"Did she," asked Keith.</p>
<p>"Yes, she really did," the mother admitted. "She was ashamed of
the way she looked and was dressed, and yet she was quite pretty,
and she had the most wonderful hair that reached to her feet when
she let it down."</p>
<p>"But, why didn't she tell somebody?" Keith insisted, his blood
running hot with wrath at the injustice to which Granny had been
submitted.</p>
<p>"Oh, because ..." said his mother wearily, "because your
grandmother has always been peculiar in that way when she knew she
was being wronged. 'What is the use?' she says. And then word came
that her father had gone bankrupt and had died soon after. No one
seemed to pay the least attention to her. She stayed where she was,
and she couldn't work any harder than she had done all the time.
But when she was to be confirmed, and had to go to church every
week with all the other children of her own age, she was the
poorest of them all, both in fact and in appearance, she didn't
have one person in the world to whom she could turn. She has told
me that she used to lie awake nights crying and thinking of running
away, but she couldn't make up her mind to that either."</p>
<p>She stopped, and Keith waited in vain for the rest of the
story.</p>
<p>"And then," he urged.</p>
<p>"Oh, then she came to Stockholm and married your grandfather--my
papa, you know. And now Lena is waiting for me to tell her what we
are to have for dinner."</p>
<p>Keith went back to his own corner for a while. Then he made a
dash for the kitchen, where he found Granny seated in her usual
place peeling potatoes. Having placed a smaller foot-stool beside
the large one in which she was seated, he got up on it so that he
could put both arms about her neck. Pressing his own soft cheek
against hers, he asked brokenly:</p>
<p>"Are you very unhappy, Granny?"</p>
<p>"No," she answered placidly, "not when you are willing to give
me a kiss."</p>
<p>"All right," he said without enthusiasm as he complied with her
request. At the same time he recalled suddenly that he had not
played a single game with his tin soldiers that whole morning.</p>
<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 35%;">
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="I_XII"></a>XII</h2>
<br>
<p>The boy had a logical mind. He knew that Granny's story had not
been finished, and he wanted all of it. At the first opportune
moment he asked his mother:</p>
<p>"Was Granny a little girl when she came to Stockholm?"</p>
<p>"No," said his mother unsuspectingly, "she was already a young
woman."</p>
<p>"What did she do before?"</p>
<p>"I told you," the mother replied, now on her guard.</p>
<p>"You told me what she did as a little girl, but not afterwards.
I want to know."</p>
<p>"Oh, she worked, I suppose."</p>
<p>There was evidently nothing more to be had in that
direction.</p>
<p>"And what did she do in Stockholm," Keith pushed on.</p>
<p>"She married your grandfather, as I told you, and then I was
born."</p>
<p>"What was he?"</p>
<p>The mother remained silent for a good long while, and Keith
repeated his question, not yet having learned that unanswered
questions generally are unwelcome questions.</p>
<p>"He was a <i>vaktm&auml;stare</i>," she said finally, and Keith
knew that, for some reason, she found the word unpleasant.</p>
<p>The boy reflected a while before he observed:</p>
<p>"That's what papa is."</p>
<p>"Your father's position is quite different," his mother rejoined
sharply. "It's a shame that he and his comrades in the bank have no
other title--although some of them deserve nothing better."</p>
<p>"What should they be called?"</p>
<p>"I don't know exactly--collectors, I think, because they go
around and collect the money that is due to the bank."</p>
<p>"And what are real <i>vaktm&auml;stare</i> doing?"</p>
<p>"The real ones work in government departments--not as officials,
but just as attendants--it's something you can't understand
yet."</p>
<p>Keith nodded. He didn't understand, but the words stuck and the
understanding came later.</p>
<p>"And those that are not real," he persisted.</p>
<p>His mother laughed and patted him on the head.</p>
<p>"There is a lot of them," she said. "They look after coats and
hats in theatres and restaurants, and wait at dinners, and do all
sorts of things."</p>
<p>"Was that what grandfather was doing?"</p>
<p>A queer look came into his mother's eyes and sent a glow of
self-satisfaction through his whole being. The look was familiar to
him and meant that his mother was annoyed by the question but
pleased with his cleverness in thinking of it.</p>
<p>"No," she answered, "not exactly...."</p>
<p>"What did he do," asked Keith, and as he spoke he sent a look of
anticipation toward his own corner.</p>
<p>"He was an attendant in the big club where all the rich
business-men go to spend their evenings, and he died when I was a
little girl ... have you nothing else to ask about?"</p>
<p>"What was papa's father," Keith ventured after a pause.</p>
<p>"He worked in the royal palace." Again the mother's tone served
as a warning, but also as a goad to the boy's curiosity.</p>
<p>"What did he do there," he demanded eagerly.</p>
<p>The lines about his mother's mouth grew tighter and harder, and
she spoke as if the words hurt her--but she did not refuse to
answer, and she did not send him away:</p>
<p>"He was a lackey."</p>
<p>From the moment he began to speak, Keith had showed an unusual
sense for the value and peculiarities of words. They interested him
for their own sake, one might say. He treasured them, and he gave
more thought to them than to people. The word lackey he had heard
before, and he had formed a distinct opinion about it as not
desirable.</p>
<p>"Then he was a servant," he blurted out.</p>
<p>"In a way," his mother admitted. "And we are all servants, for
that matter. But working in the king's palace is not like--working
as Lena does here, for instance."</p>
<p>The last part of her remark went by unheeded by Keith. His
thoughts leapt instead to his paternal grandmother--a strict and
unapproachable little lady who visited them at rare intervals
dressed in a quaint old shawl and a lace-trimmed cap. A great
wonder, not unmixed with pleasure, rose in his mind at the thought
that her husband had been a sort of servant after all. For some
reason utterly beyond him, there was solace as well as humiliation
in the consciousness of a stigma, if such it be, that attached
equally to both his grandfathers, and not only to his mother's
parent. Then a new idea prompted a new question.</p>
<p>"Was Granny a servant when she came to Stockholm?"</p>
<p>"She was obliged to take service in order to live," his mother
replied very gently. "There is nothing about that to be ashamed
of.... I have known fine ladies who started in the kitchen. But, of
course, one doesn't like to talk of it to everybody."</p>
<p>Keith recognized the hint in her final words, but thought it
needless. He was already on his way back to his own corner, tired
for the time of asking questions, when he suddenly turned and
said:</p>
<p>"We are just as good as anybody else, are we not?"</p>
<p>It was a phrase he had overheard sometime. Now it seemed to fit
the occasion, and it sounded good to him.</p>
<p>"There is the royal family," his mother rejoined enigmatically.
"But one of Granny's cousins was a lieutenant-colonel in the
army."</p>
<p>"Where is he now," Keith demanded, agog with interest.</p>
<p>"He is dead, and--and we have never had anything to do with his
family."</p>
<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 35%;">
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="I_XIII"></a>XIII</h2>
<br>
<p>The inquisitiveness of Keith with regard to his ancestors and
the past life of his parents continued for quite a while. Other
family connections seemed unreal and did not interest him. Having
no sister or brother of his own, relationships of that kind were
meaningless to him. Parents, on the other hand, constituted a
tangible personal experience, and the presence of Granny taught
that this experience was common to grown-up people as well as
children.</p>
<p>The curiosity he evinced was queerly impersonal, however, and
might well be called intellectual. The information he received had
no power over his own life. He could have been told anything, and
he would have accepted it calmly as something not affecting
himself. The only thing that influenced him was the manner of the
person answering his questions. To that manner he was almost
morbidly sensitive, and from it he concluded whether the various
details related should please or disturb him.</p>
<p>Instinctively he pressed his inquiries at points eliciting
marked resistance. And it was not what he actually learned, but the
evasions encountered, that produced the sensitiveness about his own
backgrounds which later often influenced his attitude harmfully at
moments when he most needed complete self-assurance. It was the
reluctance with which certain parts of the family history were
told, and the total withholding of others, that taught him to be
ashamed of things for which he could not be held personally
responsible. The effect of this lesson on his character was the
more fatal because it remained unconscious so long. Having become
doubtful as to the worth of the roots of the tree, it was only
natural that he should also feel doubts about the fruit.</p>
<p>Concerning the real character of his forbears he learned next to
nothing. All that he heard related to external circumstances that
were, or were not, judged respectable and presentable. One fact in
particular was subject to the most rigid exclusion from all family
conversations, and yet it leaked down to Keith at a time when he
was utterly incapable of appreciating its significance. It piqued
him mightily without disturbing him.</p>
<p>One day they were visited by his father's married sister, who
was lacking in sentimentality and had a disturbing way of calling a
spade a spade. The inevitable testing of the boy's cleverness by
making him tell his own name led to a discussion of family names in
general, Keith's mother expressing a great admiration for that of
Wellander.</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, it's good enough," remarked her sister-in-law, "but it
is not the right one, you know, and the old one was much
finer."</p>
<p>"I know," said the mother, "but I don't know what the name used
to be."</p>
<p>"Cederskj&ouml;ld, and I think it was recognized as noble. I
never knew the inside of it, but it looks peculiar. Carl's and my
father and his brother and two sisters took common action to get
the family name changed to Wellander. I am sure my grandfather must
have been up to some rather striking deviltry, and for all I know
he might have been hanged."</p>
<p>"Hush," cried Keith's mother with a quick glance at the boy who
was taking in everything with wide-open eyes and ears.</p>
<p>Keith did not wait for anything more, but sneaked off by himself
to think. The change of the name seemed nothing at the time, but
the suggestion that his great-grandfather had been hanged was
startling enough to give food for many meditations. Fortunately, or
unfortunately, his aunt's manner had been too nonchalant to give
him any clues. And from the manner of his mother he gathered merely
that the asking of questions would be useless. So it came about
that Keith for the first time in his life regretted the premature
death of his paternal grandfather, from whom, otherwise, he might
have elicited some more satisfactory information.</p>
<p>Both grandfathers were dead long before Keith was born. He never
saw a portrait of either of them, or had an idea of how they
looked. He could not even recall having heard their Christian
names. The personality of his paternal grandfather always remained
a total blank to him. Of the other one he knew a little more. The
fashionable club where his mother's father served was notorious for
its conviviality and reckless gambling, and the men were like the
masters to some extent. This one of his grandfathers used to love
wine, women, cards and everything else that helped to modify life's
general drabness. He must have been something of a wit, too, in his
own circles, having any number of boon companions. Keith never
heard what kind of a man he was at home. He made good money while
he lived and spent it as carelessly as he earned it. At forty-two
he died, leaving a penniless widow to look after a daughter still
in her early teens. Keith's paternal grandfather died in the same
way, but his widow, who was a hard-headed little woman of old
peasant stock--the best in Sweden--did better with four children
than the other grandmother with one.</p>
<p>There were gaps in the stories of his mother and Granny
concerning which he never got a direct reply from them, but by
degrees he picked up many missing details from other sources. What
he learned in this way indicated merely that they had been very
poor at times, and poverty had forced them to earn a living by work
that was quite honest and decent, but not "socially respectable."
At one time, before her daughter was old enough to assume a share
of the burden, Granny had actually had to fall back on the coarsest
and humblest menial work--scrubbing and washing by the day in
strange houses. Yet she and her daughter appeared throughout that
ordeal to have remained on terms of pleasant intimacy with friends
of the class to which they regarded themselves as properly
belonging.</p>
<p>Another problem never solved for Keith was what kind of
schooling his mother had had. Her own failure to tell suggested
that it must have been of the slightest. Yet Keith never thought of
her as ignorant. She had a bright, eager mind that, when not
clouded, acted as a goad on his own. It was she who taught him to
read and filled him with an awe for books and book-learning that
was, perhaps, not entirely wholesome. She herself read eagerly,
though fitfully, her interest in all such matters varying greatly
with her mood and condition. Her day-dreaming was to a large extent
directed toward matters literary and artistic. Sometimes, when she
had read some novel with a markedly sentimental appeal, she talked
vaguely of old ambitions to write, but as a rule it was her
ignorance of music that she deplored. In the meantime her
lace-making and her embroidery proved an artistic sense not wholly
confined to dreams. She was always busy with some work of that
kind, but her longings went far beyond it, and it happened more
than once that she let her work drop in her lap while she looked at
Keith with an expression he could not understand.</p>
<p>"If only I had had your chance in life," she exclaimed on one
occasion of that kind.</p>
<p>"What do you mean," asked the boy, snuggling close to her.</p>
<p>"I mean that you will study and be able to do things," she
answered, bending down to kiss him.</p>
<p>At that very moment the father entered and heard what she
said.</p>
<p>"Nonsense," he broke in. "The boy is going to learn a trade, and
I think we'll ask Uncle Granstedt to make a carpenter of him."</p>
<p>To Keith it was all meaningless, and his mother said nothing at
the time, but a slight stiffening of her face warned him that his
father's remark pointed in a direction not held desirable by her.
And from that sign the boy took his cue.</p>

<br>
<p>The outside door stood open and no one was in the kitchen but
Granny. The temptation to explore was irresistible.</p>
<p>"When the cat's away, the rats dance on the tray," the old
grandmother muttered as if to herself.</p>
<p>"I'll just have a peep," Keith explained, turning to her for a
moment. Then he made for the open door again.</p>
<p>The landing with its bare stone floor was familiar to him and
quite barren of interest. What drew him magnetically was the tall
archway leading to the mysterious upper regions known as the
garret, where strange old women lived in hermit cells, and whence
disturbing noises issued day and night. Even as he looked up there,
he could hear a spookish grating that seemed to symbolize the
spirit of the place. He shuddered a little, but not unpleasantly,
for he knew what caused it.</p>
<p>In the brick wall ending the upward vista, he could see a square
open hole with an iron shutter held open at right angles by an iron
rod. As the wind shook the shutter, the rod scraped against the
socket that held its hooked end. That was all--but on dark winter
afternoons the effect was most disturbing.</p>
<p>"I'm not afraid," Keith announced, sensing his own bravery
rather keenly.</p>
<p>"Why should you be," asked Granny.</p>
<p>Then he noticed the tall iron door fastened to one side of the
arch in front of it. Now it was doubled up length-wise and folded
back so as to leave the passage free.</p>
<p>"What's that for," he asked, pointing to the door.</p>
<p>"In case of fire," said Granny. "If it should begin to burn up
there, they would close that door to keep the flames from the rest
of the house."</p>
<p>"Would it burn much," Keith wondered.</p>
<p>"Your father has five cords of good birch wood stored in the top
attic, so I think the whole city would see the blaze."</p>
<p>"And the people up there?"</p>
<p>"They would have to come before we closed the doors, but God
have mercy on us if it ever gets that far. Remember, boy, there is
nothing worse than fire so you must always be careful never play
with matches."</p>
<p>"I know," said Keith, nodding sagely.</p>
<p>But he really did not know what fire meant until a few nights
later. The whole family was sound asleep, Keith on the
chaiselongue, his father and mother in the big bed on the other
side of the room. While still half asleep he could hear his mother
crying his father's name in a strangely agitated voice.</p>
<p>Then he woke fully and looked up. Every object in the room was
clearly visible, but the light coming through the windows was not
daylight. It was reddish and glaring, and the very reflection of it
within the room filled the boy with vague uneasiness.</p>
<p>The father jumped out of bed and ran to the window.</p>
<p>"It is fire," he said. "Something terrible. My Lord, half the
town must be burning. The whole sky is a mass of flames. And it's
in the direction of the bank."</p>
<p>Suddenly he turned back and began to dress in wordless
haste.</p>
<p>"Must we get out," asked the mother.</p>
<p>"No, it is not very close yet, but you had better get up and
dress--and get everybody dressed."</p>
<p>By that time he was putting on his overcoat.</p>
<p>"Where are you going, Carl," demanded the mother, evidently more
scared by his going out than by the fire.</p>
<p>"To the bank," answered the father, grimly.</p>
<p>"You mustn't, Carl! I won't let you go out! Think if anything
should happen to you!"</p>
<p>"Nonsense," he said. "I am in no danger--but I must see what's
happening to the bank, and help if things have to be taken
out."</p>
<p>"Carl, Carl...." was all the mother could get over her lips.</p>
<p>"Don't worry, Ann," he pleaded, bending over her for a minute,
and his voice took on a tenderness Keith seemed never to have heard
before. "I shall be careful, but I must go. If the fire should come
this way, I'll be back in time to help you all out."</p>
<p>She tried to cling to him, but he freed himself with gentle
firmness. In a minute more he was gone, and in the next second
Keith's mother was at the window looking out, though she had only
her night-linen on and it was late autumn. Unobserved and
unrebuked, Keith joined her, and when he looked up at the sky, his
heart almost stopped beating.</p>
<p>A ghastly stillness reigned outside--except when it was merely
accentuated by the occasional sound of hurried steps along the
street at the top of the lane. Finally some one was heard passing
through the lane itself.</p>
<p>"Please," Keith's mother cried at the top of her voice. "What is
it?"</p>
<p>"It's the German Church," a voice responded from below. "The
whole spire is flaming like a torch."</p>
<p>"Are we in danger down here?"</p>
<p>"Hard to tell. It depends on which way the spire falls. If it
falls outward, I fear the whole city will go."</p>
<p>Then he walked off.</p>
<p>By that time the servant girl had come in weeping as if she had
just heard her death-doom announced, and from the Granny was
calling to them:</p>
<p>"You'll freeze to death, all of you, if you don't put on some
clothes."</p>
<p>So they dressed, though difficulty, and then there was nothing
to do but to wait. The mother was at the window all the time, every
few minutes she said to the boy:</p>
<p>"Oh, I hope nothing happens to your father!"</p>
<p>At first it scared him more than did the light. But after a
while it began to have an opposite effect. He seemed to grow stiff
and hard. The excitement of the fire was still there, but it was
overlaid and almost neutralized by a vast impatience that seemed to
take possession of his whole being. He felt that if his mother made
the same remark once more, he should yell with rage and agony, and
to save himself, he joined Granny in the kitchen, where the girl
had started a fire in order to make some coffee.</p>
<p>The sky in that quarter was just as bright as in front, and no
light was needed in the room.</p>
<p>Suddenly he heard his mother cry out:</p>
<p>"Oh."</p>
<p>At the same time the brightness seemed to increase to something
more than daylight.</p>
<p>A quick change took place in the boy's heart. He ran into the
living-room and put his arm about his mother who was still lying in
the window.</p>
<p>"Don't worry, mamma," he whispered to her. "I'll take care of
you."</p>
<p>There was something in his voice that brought the mother to
herself. She closed the window and took him in her arms and kissed
him as she had never kissed him before, he thought.</p>
<p>"It was the spire that fell just now," she said, "and if there
is any danger, your father will be here in a minute."</p>
<p>Almost as she spoke, the glare outside began to die down, though
the sky remained red and threatening until daybreak.</p>
<p>Then they had coffee, Keith being allowed an extra dose in his
milk. And soon afterwards the father returned to tell the story of
the fire and inform them that all danger was over as far as they
were concerned.</p>
<p>For days afterwards the experiences of that night occupied
Keith's mind. The joy of excitement was probably uppermost in spite
of all other considerations, Beneath it was a vivid conception of
the horrors of fire that remained a live thing in his mind until he
was well on in years, sometimes waking him out of his sleep at
night and setting his heart palpitating wildly at the mere idea of
danger. Lastly, however, there was left from that momentous night a
new attitude toward the mother that implied a direct criticism--the
first one that had ever broken into clear consciousness. It did not
make him love her less, but it changed the character of his love in
some subtle way. The father, on the other hand, had gained by that
night. There was something heroic about the quiet way in which he
walked off to take care of the bank, pushing all other
considerations aside until that duty had been filled.</p>

<h2><a name="I_XV"></a>XV</h2>
<br>
<p>Gradually Keith learned to know the old house from top to
bottom. The garret and the cellar remained of excitement for a long
time. The rest of it offered little to hold the attention or feed
the imagination.</p>
<p>It covered three sides of a rectangle, with the courtyard in the
centre. The wall of the adjoining house; formed the fourth side--a
sheer cliff of plastered brick that towered two whole stories
higher, its dreary expanse unbroken by a single window. Along the
foot of it ran a long low structure with innumerable doors opening
on the courtyard. Thither men, women and children had to descend
regardless of weather or hour or season, and every visitor could be
watched from the windows opening on the yard.</p>
<p>The rear part of the house constituted practically a building by
itself, with a stairway of its own, and the people living there
seemed to form a world apart, with which Keith never became very
well acquainted. But on the ground-floor of that part was the
laundry, used in turn by every household in the entire house and
regarded by the boy as a far-off, adventurous place until he had
been allowed to visit it a couple of times.</p>
<p>The building facing the lane and that running along the
courtyard had a stairway in common at the corner where they joined.
Its stairs and landings were of stone, uncarpeted, and lighted in
the day by a window on each floor and at night by a single gas jet
on each landing. At the foot of the lowermost flight of stairs was
a long and dark passage that turned at a right angle and finally
reached the lane after what seemed a long walk. Branching to the
right, at the foot of the stairs, was another passage from which
the cellar was reached after you had used all your strength to push
open a huge iron door that squeaked uncannily on its stiff
hinges.</p>
<p>The flats on the second and third floors ran straight through
from the lane to the rear building, but on the fourth floor, where
Keith lived, another family occupied the rooms looking upon the
courtyard. And there lived Jonas, the only other child in the house
during Keith's earliest years.</p>
<p>Jonas' father was a compositor--a tall, lank, hollow-eyed man
with a bad cough. His mother was a woman of the people, angular and
taciturn. Jonas himself was pale and gawky and shy.</p>
<p>Those two families, living within a few feet of each other and
meeting daily on the common landing, had little more intercourse
than if they had been parted by miles of desert. The reserved and
slightly eccentric character of the neighbours had something to do
with this separation, but social distinctions counted for more. A
compositor was, after all, a mere workman, and Keith felt
instinctively that his mother looked with kindly contempt at the
more primitive ways of the adjoining household. Now and then he was
permitted to go and play for a little while with Jonas, who was a
year older, but the other boy hardly ever entered Keith's home. Nor
was their playing much of a success. Jonas was slow-witted and
reserved, while alertness and frankness were among Keith's most
characteristic traits. But differences of temperament accounted
only in part for their failure to come together. Keith felt as if a
wall of some kind stood between them, and as if the eyes watching
from the other side of that wall were distinctly hostile at times.
It exasperated him as if it had implied terrible injustice, but it
was only in moments of extreme boredom he really cared. At such
moments he would also develop a passionate desire for a brother or
sister. He might have wished for a dog or a cat even, but the idea
of such a disturbing element in his parental home seemed too
preposterous for serious contemplation. In fact, so foreign was
that idea to the home atmosphere, that Keith went through the rest
of his life envying other people's pets without ever giving earnest
thought to the acquisition of one for himself.</p>
<p>Just as the parental attitude toward the nearest neighbours
suggested a kindly but unsentimental tolerance of inferiors, so it
became unmistakably tinged with a slightly jealous but unprotesting
submission to superiors whenever the lower floors were reached. A
bachelor official of some kind lived on the floor immediately
below, with no one but his housekeeper to share his spacious
apartment. As deputy landlord, Keith's father had to see this
tenant like all the rest, but of social intercourse there was none,
while on the other hand, Keith's mother kept up a gossiping
acquaintance with the housekeeper. As far as Keith himself was
concerned, there was nothing more awe-inspiring than a chance
meeting on the stairs with the monocle, side-whiskers, precise
manners and doled-out civility of Mr. Bureau-Chief Brostr&ouml;m.
The distance was so immense that even aspirations were precluded on
the part of the boy. He could imagine being king, but not a duly
appointed government official with a salary enabling him to occupy
half a dozen rooms practically by himself.</p>
<p>Of course, there were rumours afloat about a more intimate
relationship between the bureau chief and his fairly good-looking
housekeeper, who nominally had for her own that part of the flat
which faced the courtyard, and these rumours did not escape the
boy's keen ears. While their true inwardness was incomprehensible
to him, they made him look wonderingly at the housekeeper whenever
he met her, and when he accepted her gingersnaps and other tempting
delicacies, he did so with a sense of wickedness that limited his
gratefulness.</p>
<p>A retired dry goods dealer and his good-hearted old wife lived
on the second floor. The Fernbloms were the aristocracy of the
house in the lane, having the best rooms, paying the highest rent
and giving the biggest parties, but even Keith guessed quite early
that they were simple souls, risen by thrift from very humble
origins. They had a single daughter, a girl of delicate health and
looks with whom Keith probably would have fallen in love hopelessly
if she had stayed in the house. But she married early, moved to
some other city and was rarely seen in her old home. Reports of her
progress were received, of course, and passed on in the hearing of
Keith, but like so many other things not touching his own life
closely, it carried no real meaning to his mind. The parties
continued, and Keith's parents were often invited, partly because
the old couple was too simple-minded to think of social
distinctions, and partly because they both came from the same
district as Keith's Granny. Keith would be allowed to come along at
times, and he liked the idea of going and the good food, but
otherwise he found it dull business watching a lot of grown-up
people seated solemnly about square tables playing cards. Then, one
day, the old lady died, and Keith attended a part of the funeral,
and from the window he saw the coffin taken away in a hearse buried
in flowers. It made him ask many questions of his mother, but none
of her answers brought death any closer to his mind. After all, the
old lady had been nothing to him, and if the parties should cease
as he heard was likely, the loss did not seem great to him. The
only thing that made a real difference to him was his discovery
that there would be no more of those ball-shaped gingersnaps that
the old lady used to bake herself and keep in an earthen jar almost
as tall as Keith.</p>
<p>The front part of the ground floor was used as an office of some
kind in those early days, but the middle part facing the long row
of outhouses was a human habitation. The rooms were so dark that a
lamp had to be used most of the day, and the principal entrance was
direct from the courtyard. An old workman and his wife lived there
until the office in front was changed into a coffee-house and those
rooms toward the courtyard became the kitchen. When it happened,
some one told Keith's mother a story which she in her turn conveyed
to the boy.</p>
<p>History repeated itself, she said, and Keith already knew that
history was something that had happened before he was born. One
hundred years ago, when Gustavus III was king of Sweden and things
were more exciting than in these later days of outward and inward
peace, there used also to be a coffee-house on the ground floor,
and a widely known one at that. It occupied the floor above too,
but this floor was in reality used as a club, and the club was
political and the men who frequented it were conspiring against the
government. This the police knew, and every so often a lot of armed
and uniformed men would surround the house and make prisoners of
those caught in the clubrooms on the second floor. But as a rule no
one was found there but a couple of sleepy and grouchy attendants
who cursed their luck at having to spend their lives in such a dull
place.</p>
<p>"But," Keith interrupted when the story got that far "you just
told me that the rooms had a lot of conspirators in them."</p>
<p>"So they had."</p>
<p>"And yet they were empty when the police came there? Do you
really mean that the people could make themselves invisible?"</p>
<p>"That's where the real story comes in," his mother explained.
"You know there is a long passageway between the front rooms of the
Fernbloms and their kitchen in the rear. It runs back of the
stairs. The next time you go through it, stamp your foot very hard,
and you will hear that it sounds hollow in one place. At that spot
there used to be a trap door in the floor. Now it is nailed down
hard, but in the old days it could be opened any time, and then you
found a stairway below. It led into our part of the cellar, where
you still can find a couple of stone steps at one end. Then the
conspirators went down into the main cellar, and at the back of it
there was a tunnel leading under the rear part of the house and the
lane beyond to a house on the other side. That's the way they
escaped, and that's why the police never found anybody in the
club."</p>
<p>"What did the conspirators want," asked Keith after he had
pondered the matter for a while.</p>
<p>"I don't know exactly," his mother admitted, "but the king was
killed by one of them at last."</p>
<p>"I wish I had been there to defend the king," said Keith. Then a
new thought seized him suddenly: "I want to go down and see those
steps."</p>
<p>"All right," his mother answered to his astonishment and joy.
"Lena will soon go down to get potatoes for dinner, and then you
can go along, if you only promise to come right up again."</p>
<p>Shortly afterwards the momentous expedition actually took place.
Keith had been as far as the outer cellar door before, but he had
never cared to go further. When you opened that door, you were met
by an air so cold and damp that it struck your face like a wet
sheet, and the stairs fell away into a black abyss that seemed
bottomless.</p>
<p>The door was of iron, rounded at the top to fit the arch, and
covered with rust. It looked as if it had been in its place since
the house was built, and Keith had heard that the house could not
be less than two hundred years old. The key, which Keith had been
permitted to carry going down, was of iron too, and nearly twice as
long as Keith's hand. The lock was in keeping with the key,
enormous in size and so stiff that Lena had to use both hands to
turn the key.</p>
<p>Having laid a firm hold of Lena's skirt, Keith followed her
several steps down until they reached a place in the opposite wall
where a single very tall step led up to another iron door,
square-cut and narrow, back of which lay the cellar used by the
Wellanders. Lena lighted a candle that burned with difficulty in
the clammy air.</p>
<p>Inside nothing could be seen at first but a number of boxes and
barrels full of supplies, and back of them walls built out of
enormous stone blocks and dripping with moisture. As his eyes
became accustomed to the dim light, however, Keith perceived that
the end toward the lane was closed by a wall which even his
inexperienced glance recognized as brick and comparatively new.
Squeezing between two large barrels of potatoes he saw two stone
steps at the foot of that wall and managed actually to put his foot
on one of them.</p>
<p>"I wish I knew what's back of that wall," he remarked at
last.</p>
<p>"Oh, nothing," said Lena indifferently.</p>
<p>"There might be skeletons," he ventured after a pause.</p>
<p>"Jesus Christ, child," Lena almost screamed, looking as if she
had caught sight of a ghost. "Where in the world does he get such
notions from? Come out of here now. I think the master will have to
go down for potatoes himself hereafter."</p>
<p>"There was a skeleton in the story you told me the other night,"
Keith protested with dignity, but not unaffected by the girl's
unmistakable fright.</p>
<p>"This is no place for stories of that kind," she declared
pulling him away from the barrels and almost forgetting to close
the cellar door behind her.</p>
<p>That evening Keith kept thinking of the story and the steps in
the cellar. He was sorry not to be able to walk up those stairs.
And there must be some old things left lying about on them. Then he
imagined himself a conspirator, hearing the police beating at the
doors and making his way through the stairway and the tunnel to
some quiet, unobserved doorway in another lane, much narrower and
darker than their own. It was exciting, the passage through the
tunnel, which he could see with his mind's eye--but the part of
conspirator did not appeal to him. He had seen policemen on the
street several times. They were very tall and carried sabres. Some
time when he was conspiring they might be too quick for him and get
him before he could reach the secret stairway. It would be much
better, he decided finally, to be able to look them in the face and
say truthfully:</p>
<p>"I have done nothing at all!"</p>
<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 35%;">
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="I_XVI"></a>XVI</h2>
<br>
<p>The regular meals of the day were four, not counting "afternoon
coffee" which was regarded as a special treat and always subject to
negotiations, though forthcoming as unfailingly as dinner or
supper. It was the natural and nominal counterpart of the "morning
coffee," which served to initiate the day's feeding. This first
meal was consumed separately, as each person was ready for work,
and on the whole its name was appropriate, although plenty of bread
went with the coffee. Keith's turn came generally a little after
seven, when he sat down to a large cup or bowl of half coffee and
half milk into which had been broken a good sized piece of hard
Swedish rye-bread. A little sugar was allowed, but no butter. This
regimen began when Keith was less than three years old, and he
enjoyed it immensely, provided the bread had steeped long enough to
become soft, When, at last, he turned to rolls and butter dipped
into the coffee, it did not mean that his taste had changed, but
merely that his increasing sense of manhood found the earlier dish
too childish.</p>
<p>Breakfast was due about ll:30 and consisted generally of sundry
left-overs from the preceding day, bread and butter forming one of
the principal ingredients. Then came the main meal of the day,
dinner, between 3:30 and 4 in the afternoon. As a rule it had only
two courses: some meat dish or fish with potatoes, and a soup
served last. Now and then there was a vegetable. Desserts were
reserved for special occasions. To Keith each such meal was
inseparably connected with the parental admonition: "Eat plenty of
bread with your meat, child." The bread was of the hard kind
already referred to--thin round cakes that one broke to pieces and
that gave the teeth plenty of work. Various superstitions were
invoked to promote the consumption of it. Thus the failure to
finish a piece already broken off was alleged to result in the
transfer of all one's strength to the actual consumer of the piece
left behind. Keith was a docile child in spite of his impulsiveness
and he did he was told and believed what he heard, but he often
wondered why the rules so strictly enforced himself did not apply
to his parents.</p>
<p>"Afternoon coffee," generally accompanied by some form of sweet
bread or cake, "happened" about 5:30, and at 8 supper was served.
The final meal was commonly made up of sandwiches with porridge and
milk, or perhaps, when fate was remarkably propitious, thin
pancakes with cranberry jam. There might be an extra snack of food
at a still later hour in case of unexpected callers, but such
visits were not frequent and Keith would be asleep by that time
anyhow.</p>
<p>It was different when parties were given to formally invited
company. Then Keith had to stay up--or pretend to do so--as long as
the guests remained, and he must have a share of whatever the house
had to offer. To such occasions he looked forward with feverish
joy, not so much on account of the good things dispensed as for the
sake of feeling the ordinary strict rules relaxed. Apart from
Christmas, the principal celebrations took place on his parents'
birthdays and "namedays." Every day in the Swedish calendar carries
a name, and all those bearing it have a right to expect
felicitations and presents from their relations and more intimate
friends. In return they are expected to celebrate the occasion with
a party that gives an excuse for showing what the house can do in
the way of hospitality. The same thing applies to the birthday
anniversaries, only in a higher degree. Not to celebrate one's
birthday can only be a sign of poverty, miserliness or misanthropy,
and to overlook the birthday anniversary of a close relative is to
risk an immediate breach of connections.</p>
<p>Nothing was more familiar to Keith than his mother's open
worries about money and his father's occasional stern reference to
the need of saving. To the boy those complaints and warnings meant
merely that the parents were in a depressed and unfaourable mood,
tending to draw the usual constraint a little tighter about him. He
was intensely sensitive to atmosphere, and too often that of his
home had the same effect on his young soul as the low-hanging,
leaden skies of a Swedish December day before the first snow has
fallen. It made him long for sunlight, and the parties brought it
to some extent. Then care and caution were forgotten, although his
father might grumble before and after. Then the daily routine was
broken, and Granny became cynically but actively interested, bent
above all on seeing that "the house would not be shamed."</p>
<p>When the great day came, the home, always scrupulously neat,
shone with cleanliness. Every one worked up to the last minute.
Cupboards and pantries were full of unfamiliar and enticing
supplies. The dining table, opened to its utmost length, groaned
under the burden of innumerable cold dishes of tempting appearance,
while from the kitchen came the odours of more substantial courses
still in the making. A one end of Granny's bureau stood a battery
of multicoloured bottles. The other end was jammed with desserts
and goodies meant to be served while the guests were waiting for
supper or during the card game that generally followed it. Better
than anything else, however, was the father's loud laugh and eager
talk, so rarely heard in the course of their regular daily
existence. Even then he might be displeased by some slight slip of
the boy's, and a sharp rebuke might follow, but it seemed forgotten
as soon as uttered, and of other consequences there were none to be
feared. Therefore, Keith wished that there might be a party every
day, and while there was one going on he sometimes caught himself
wondering whether, after all, he did not like his father as much as
his mother, or more.</p>
<p>From his own experiences with food as well as from his parents'
attitude toward it, both on special and on ordinary occasions,
Keith distilled a sort of philosophy that it took him several
decades to outlive. To him eating became a good thing in itself,
rather than a means to an end. His parents were neither gluttons
nor gourmets, but they liked good food, and, what was of still
greater importance, good eating represented the principal source of
enjoyment open to them. The same seemed true of their friends, and
when company arrived no topic was more in favour than a comparison
of past culinary enjoyments. Keith's father, for instance, never
grew tired of telling about the time when he was still the chief
clerk in a fashionable grocery and the owner gave him permission to
dispose freely of a keg of Holland oysters that threatened to "go
bad" before they could be sold. Four or five friends were drummed
together. The feast took place at night in the store itself. Bread,
butter, salt, pepper, liquor, beer and cards were the only things
added to the oysters.</p>
<p>"And when morning came, and I had to open the store, there was
nothing left but a keg full of empty shells," the father used to
shout, laughing at the same time so that it was hard to catch what
he said. Then he would smack his lips and add with earnest
conviction: "I have never tasted anything better unless it be the
Russian caviar we used to import for the Court."</p>
<p>Always it was a matter of quantity as well as quality. A feast
was not a feast without more than plenty. Eating was always in
order. An offer of a dish was as good as a command to partake. A
refusal bordered on the offensive. Pressing a reluctant guest was
the highest form of hospitality. Dietary precautions were
apparently unheard of except in the case of certain chronic
ailments, and then they were accepted as one of life's worst evils.
To eat well was to be well, and the natural conclusion was that the
best cure in case of trouble was to eat. Lack of appetite was a
misfortune as well as a dangerous symptom, and to eat when not
hungry was not only a necessity but a virtue.</p>
<p>Yet Keith longed for other things and he learned early that even
eating has its drawbacks.</p>

<p>Except on Sundays, the father rarely ate with the rest of the
family. He left in the morning before Keith was up and never came
home for breakfast. His dinner often had to wait until five or six
or even later, so he seldom cared to eat again when the others had
their supper.</p>
<p>One afternoon, however, he appeared just as Keith and his mother
were to sit for dinner. It put her in a flutter and she couldn't
get an additional cover laid quick enough.</p>
<p>"I heard that mother was coming," he remarked as he seated
himself at the table.</p>
<p>Instantly Keith's mother shot an apprehensive glance at the boy
and exclaimed:</p>
<p>"Please try to be a real nice boy now, so that your grandmother
does not get a bad impression of you." Then she added, turning to
her husband: "She never says anything, but she always looks as if I
spoiled Keith hopelessly."</p>
<p>"Well," the father rejoined thoughtfully, "she brought up four
children of her own without anybody else to help her, and there was
not one among us who dared to disregard her slightest word."</p>
<p>"How about Henrik," the mother suggested a little tartly.</p>
<p>"Yes, the one spared is the one spoiled," admitted the father
with a sigh. "He was the youngest, and while he was licked like all
of us, her hand never seemed quite as firm with him as with the
rest. The worst thing parents can do to children is to let them
have their own will."</p>
<p>Keith was listening with one ear only. His thoughts were on
Uncle Henrik, who would put in an unheralded appearance now and
then, always when the father was away and always to the
consternation of the whole household. Although hustled out of the
kitchen as soon as the unbidden visitor arrived, Keith had had a
good look at him several times and had also overheard the parents
discussing him. He was still comparatively young. Yet he looked
like animated waste matter. His face seemed to hang on him. His
mouth was loose and void of expression. His eyes were bleared and
ever on the move. He spoke mostly in a toneless drawl, that
sometimes turned into a shrill whine, but also at rare intervals
could change into a soft, heart-winning purr. His clothing was
poorer and coarser than that of any other person seen by Keith.
Once or twice it seemed to the boy like a repulsive uniform, and he
heard his parents speak with mingled disgust and relief of some
house or institution that was never fully named.</p>
<p>"No one has a better heart than Henrik," Keith heard his father
say once, "but he has no more spine than a cucumber, and he can't
keep away from drink."</p>
<p>Then the food was brought in, and Uncle Henrik was forgotten. As
usual, there was a meat course to begin with, and Keith ate what
for him was a big portion. Nor did he get into any trouble beyond
having an extra large piece of hard bread put beside his plate by
the father and finding the disposal of it rather difficult.</p>
<p>The meat was followed by a large bowl of soup, and the very
sight of it made Keith look unhappy--a fact that did not escape his
father.</p>
<p>Keith cared little for soups, while both parents liked them, and
he had a particular dislike of soups made on a meat stock, like the
one just brought in. For some reason that Keith might have thought
funny under other circumstances, it was called Carpenter Soup, and
it contained a lot of rather coarse vegetables. Among these were
green celery and parsnips, both of which filled the boy with an
almost morbid disgust.</p>
<p>While the mother was serving and Keith was waiting in dumb
agony, it flashed through his mind that Uncle Granstedt might be
eating that kind of soup. If so, the boy thought, he would rather
let himself be killed than made a carpenter.</p>
<p>As the turn came to his own plate, Keith tried to catch his
mother's eye with a signalled appeal to put in as little as
possible, but she was talking to her husband and not noticing the
boy at all. And so, at last, he found himself confronted with a
plate filled to the brim.</p>
<p>The first few spoonfuls went down without much resistance,
chiefly because he confined himself to the fluid part of the soup.
Then it seemed of a sudden as if one more mouthful would choke him,
and his eating became a mere dallying with his spoon.</p>
<p>"Go on and finish your soup," the father urged sternly.</p>
<p>"I can't."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"I have eaten all I can."</p>
<p>"That does not matter," rejoined his father. "One must always
finish what is on one's plate."</p>
<p>"But I don't like it," Keith blurted out in a moment of
desperation--which was unfortunate.</p>
<p>"Children have no likings of their own," said the father,
putting down his spoon. "They must like what their parents give
them. And you will finish that soup--if I have to feed you myself
to make you do it."</p>
<p>Two more spoonfuls went down by an heroic effort. Then Keith
burst into tears, and his father's face grew still darker as he
asked scornfully:</p>
<p>"Are you a boy or a girl?"</p>
<p>Keith did not care at that moment. In fact, he thought that if
girls had a right to cry, he would rather be one.</p>
<p>His mother was trying to coax him with kind words, and he
actually raised the filled spoon to his lips once more, but the
sensation within him was such that he let it drop again with a
splash. That was the crowning offence, and the feeding process
began at once. His father took him by the neck with one hand and
administered the spoon with the other. It was done firmly and
perhaps harshly, but in such a manner that the boy was not
hurt.</p>
<p>Keith cried and coughed and swallowed--and in the midst of that
ordeal he noticed the wonderful softness of his father's hands. But
his heart was full of bitter resentment, and he wished that he
could grow up on the spot.</p>
<p>What the end might have been is hard to tell, had not a slight
commotion been heard from the kitchen at that juncture.</p>
<p>"There is mother now," said the father, letting go his hold on
Keith's neck. "Wipe your eyes and try to act like a boy. Some day
we'll put you into skirts."</p>
<p>Keith did not care. He knew now that he would not have to eat
the rest of the soup. That was the one thing in the world that
seemed to matter to him. His tears ceased. But now his body was
shaken by a convulsive sob. On the whole his mood was one of
hopeless resignation.</p>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<h2><a name="I_XVIII"></a>XVIII</h2>
<br>
<p>"I am glad to see you, mother," said Keith's father, rising
quickly as a little old woman appeared in the kitchen doorway. His
tone surprised the boy. There was warmth in it, but still more of
reverence bordering on awe, and also something of pride. Thus might
a queen be greeted, but only by those nearest and dearest to her.
What struck the boy most of all, however, was the world of
difference lying between that tone and the one in which the father
addressed his wife even in moments of closest understanding. It
gave Keith his first clear glimpse of the distinction between love
and respect, between sympathy and trust.</p>
<p>"So you are home, Carl," the grandmother remarked in her usual
quiet, matter-of-fact manner. Then she turned to her
daughter-in-law, who had also risen to her feet: "Is your head as
bad as usual, Anna?"</p>
<p>"Thank you," answered Keith's mother, and the boy could sense
that she was not at her ease although she smiled pleasantly. "Those
new powders I got from Dr. Sk&ouml;ld helped a great deal."</p>
<p>"Hm," grunted the older woman as she walked across the room and
sat down on a chair not far from Keith. "I had no time or money to
bother with powders at your age, but times have changed."</p>
<p>She was taking in every detail of the room as she spoke, without
looking pointedly at anything in particular. Suddenly Keith, who
followed her every movement as if hypnotized, was startled by
meeting the hard gaze of her calm, pale-blue eyes. Those eyes
illuminated her small, wrinkled face so completely that the boy saw
nothing else. Gone were her trimmed wig, her black shawl, her wide
skirt of a checkered grey. Gone were even her thin, tight lips that
used to close with the firm grip of a vice. Nothing was left but
the eyes that looked him through and through until it was
impossible for him to stand still any longer.</p>
<p>"What is the matter with Keith," she asked. "Sick, too?"</p>
<p>"No, thank heaven," the mother blurted out. "We have nothing to
complain of his health--"</p>
<p>"No," the father broke in with a suggestion of grim humour, "not
about his health, but--"</p>
<p>"Of course," the old lady said with a nod of comprehension. "I
don't wish to criticize anybody or anything, but I don't think
Keith is very obedient. He wants to pick and choose, I suppose, as
if the food were not good enough for him."</p>
<p>"Well, he can't," the father rejoined.</p>
<p>"Children should eat anything and be glad to get it at that.
Mine never thought of refusing what I gave them. If they ever
had...."</p>
<p>She didn't finish the sentence, but it made Keith feel that he
would never have dared one word of protest about the soup if the
grandmother had been there a little earlier. Yet she spoke without
marked feeling, without hardness, almost kindly. It was plain as
she went on, that she believed intensely in what she said, and that
it touched the very foundations of existence as she saw it:</p>
<p>"Children owe everything to their parents, and the least they
can do in return is to accept thankfully what they get. That is
what I did in my childhood, and I never dreamt of anything else. I
had no will but that of my parents, and I knew that I could not and
should not have any will of my own."</p>
<p>Everybody but the grandmother was still standing. The mother's
face bore clear evidence of conflicting tendencies to accept and
reject. Looking at her, Keith felt, as he often did, that there was
something within her that gave his view of matters a fighting
chance. The father, on the other hand, seemed of a sudden to have
become a child himself, listening obediently and with absorbed
approval. It looked almost as if he were still afraid of that
white-haired, fragile, tight-lipped little woman, and the sight of
him filled Keith with a vague uneasiness.</p>
<p>"Please sit down," said the grandmother at last. "I did not mean
to disturb you, and Keith looks as if he might fall in a heap any
moment."</p>
<p>"Why don't you stand up straight, Keith," asked his mother. "You
will never grow up unless you do, and your grandmother will think
worse of you than she already does."</p>
<p>"I am not blaming the child," the old lady began in the same
passive, quietly assured tone. But before she got further, the
father broke in:</p>
<p>"I think Keith had better go and play in his own corner--and
please keep quiet, for grandmother and I have important things to
talk of."</p>
<p>Keith retired as directed, and at that moment growing up seemed
to him a more unreal and impossible thing than ever.</p>
<p>Not long afterwards the grandmother left, both parents escorting
her to the outside door. When they returned to the living-room,
Keith heard his mother say:</p>
<p>"I don't see why she should always find fault with Keith. He's
not a bit worse than Brita's Carl, whom she is helping to spoil
just as fast as she can."</p>
<p>"Well, that's her way," replied the father, paying no attention
to the latter part of the remark. "She was brought up that way
herself, and that's the way she brought up the four of us."</p>
<p>He was evidently in high good-humour and did what Keith had
never seen him do before when no company was present. He got out a
cigar from one of the little drawers in the upper part of mamma's
bureau and sat down at the still covered dining table to smoke it.
This made Keith feel almost as if they were having a party, and
soon he sneaked out of his corner and joined the parents at the
table. First he stood hesitatingly beside his mother, but little by
little he edged over to the father until he actually was leaning
against the latter's knee without being rebuffed. The father even
put his hand on Keith's head, and the soup episode became very
distant and dim.</p>
<p>"She used to lick us mercilessly," the father said as if
speaking chiefly to himself, and as he spoke there was a
reminiscent smile on his face and not a trace of resentment in his
voice. "But she was absolutely just about it--so just that she used
to lick all four of us whenever one had earned it. That was to keep
the rest from thinking themselves any better, she said, and also
because she felt sure that all of us had deserved it, although she
had not happened to find it out."</p>
<p>"I think it hard and unjust," Keith's mother protested. "And I
don't believe in beating children all the time."</p>
<p>"Those were hard days," the father mused on, "and everybody did
it, and children seemed to know their place better then. I don't
think we suffered very much from the beatings we got, they
certainly did not make us think less of mother. She had her hands
full, too, and not much time to think of nice distinctions. We were
all small when father died, and Henrik was just a baby. There was
no one but her to look after us, and how she did it, God only
knows. But I have never heard her speak one word of complaint, and
she always managed. Sometimes there was little enough, and we were
mighty glad to get what there was, as she told you herself, but she
always had something for us. Then we had to go to work just as soon
as we could. I was thirteen when I began to add my share to the
common heap."</p>
<p>"Did you go to school," Keith ventured, having recently
overheard some talk of his parents that seemed to bear on his own
immediate future.</p>
<p>"I did," the father replied, "but not long. I wanted to study,
and my teacher was so anxious that I should go on that he promised
to get me free admission to the higher school. But mother wouldn't
listen. And I suppose it was not to be."</p>
<p>"Did you like school," asked Keith, not having the slightest
idea of what a school might be like.</p>
<p>"Yes, I liked all about it but one thing. There was a big boy
who bullied all the rest, and no one cared to fight him. He went
for me the very first day of the term, and when I fought back, he
gave me such a licking that I could hardly walk into the schoolroom
afterwards. The next day he asked if I had had enough, and I told
him I meant to go on till he had enough. So we started right in
again, and he licked me worse than the day before. But I just
couldn't give in. For three whole months we fought every day, and
each day I made it harder for him. And one day I got the upper hand
of him at last, and gave it to him until he began to cry and begged
for mercy. Then I let him go, but no sooner had I turned my back on
him, than he picked up a small sapling that was lying around and
struck me over the head with it. There was a piece of root standing
straight out, and it hit me right on top of my head so that the
blood squirted out and I fainted on the spot. Then he had to leave
school, and the last thing I heard of him was that the police had
got him for something still worse."</p>
<p>"Oh, Carl," the mother cried with a shudder, "you should have
complained to the teacher!"</p>
<p>"The teacher was watching us all the time, although I didn't
know it. He told me afterwards that he would have helped me any
time I asked, but that he would have thought less of me for
asking."</p>
<p>Keith stared hard at his father and tried to imagine himself
doing the same thing, but his fancy did not seem to work well in
that direction. Later, when he was in bed, the father's story came
back to him. Somehow it made him feel very proud, but also uneasy.
He felt that there nothing more wonderful than to fight some one
stronger than oneself and win, and soon he was busy slaying giants
and dragons and bears and other monsters that he had heard Granny
tell about. But he tried to think of himself as fighting a real boy
in the way as his father, his dreams seemed to peter out
ignominiously.</p>
<p>Then his mother came to in to tuck him in and make him say his
prayers and kiss him good-night. Suddenly he flung his arms about
her neck in a passion of craving for tenderness and protection.
Putting his mouth close to her ear, he whispered a question that
had nothing to do with the father's story or his fancies of a few
moments ago.</p>
<p>"Why must I eat things I don't want?"</p>
<br>
<br>

<h2><a name="I_XIX"></a>XIX</h2>
<br>
<p>The next Sunday morning found Keith more than usually restless.
Half a dozen times in quick succession he appealed to the mother
for suggestions as to what to do. Finally she turned to the father,
who was preparing to go out:</p>
<p>"Can't you take him along, Carl? He has never seen the bank, and
he really should get out a little."</p>
<p>For a little while the father said nothing. Then he spoke
directly to Keith:</p>
<p>"Put on your coat and cap."</p>
<p>The boy who had been looking and listening with open mouth and a
heart that hardly dared to beat, became wildly excited.</p>
<p>"Now, Keith," the father admonished, "you can't go unless you
behave."</p>
<p>"Where's my coat, mother," asked Keith eagerly and
unheedingly.</p>
<p>"Don't you know that yourself," growled the father. "You are a
big boy already, and you should keep your own things in order."</p>
<p>"I have hung it up where he cannot reach it," the mother
interceded. "I'll get it for him."</p>
<p>The coat and the cap were on at last, but then began the
struggle about the muffler and the mittens. The mother had
crocheted them herself for Keith and insisted that they should be
worn whenever he went outdoors during autumn and winter. The
muffler was long and white, with blue rings two inches apart, and
in shape more like a boa.</p>
<p>Keith wanted the mittens, because his hands got cold easily, but
not the muffler, which, he thought, made him look like a girl.</p>
<p>The father objected to everything of that kind, which he said,
tended to make the boy soft and susceptible to colds. He himself
did not put on an overcoat until the weather grew very severe, and
he never buttoned it, no matter how cold it grew. His throat was
always bare, and he never wore gloves of any kind. Nor did he ever
put his hands in his pockets while walking. He had a favourite
trick of picking up a handful of snow, which he rolled into a ball
and carried in his hand until it became hard as ice. His hands were
milk-white, beautifully shaped and well cared for. It was
impossible to believe that for many years they had done the hardest
kind of work, often outdoors and generally in a poorly heated
drafty shop. He was proud of them, although he pretended not to
care when anybody spoke of them, and they filled Keith with
admiration and envy. He tried to follow the father's example, but
with the result that his hands grew red as boiled crawfish and
began to ache under the nails until he had to cry.</p>
<p>"You bring him up a woman," the father muttered, when Keith was
ready at last.</p>
<p>Then they left, having been kissed several times each by the
mother, who warned Keith not to let go of his father's hand under
any circumstances while they were on the streets.</p>
<p>Down in the passageway on the ground floor, Keith started to
take off the muffler.</p>
<p>"No," said the father. "Now you keep it on. Your mother has told
you to wear it, and you must not take it off behind her back."</p>
<p>"But you didn't want me to have it on," Keith protested in
genuine surprise.</p>
<p>"No, I didn't, because I want you to be hardened and grow up
like a man. But there is something I want still more, and that is
for you to obey your mother, first because children should always
obey their parents, and secondly because it makes your mother very
unhappy if you don't do as she tells you."</p>
<p>His tone changed slightly during the last part of his remark.
Something of an appeal came into it and went straight to Keith's
heart, filling it with a glow of righteous determination. It was
always that way with him. A word spoken kindly made him eager to
comply, and that was particularly the case if it came from some
person not given to sentimentality.</p>
<p>In the lane they turned and saw the mother lying in the window
to watch them. As usual, kisses were thrown back and forth as they
passed up the lane, but Keith felt rather impatient about it, and
it was with a marked sense of relief he turned the corner into East
Long Street. He was eager to push ahead into unknown regions and
did not care to look back.</p>
<p>Although he spoke little enough, the father proved a more genial
companion than Keith had dared to expect. In fact, he had been a
little oppressed at the thought of being entirely alone with the
father, which was quite a new experience to him. But now he found
it a pleasure, and their communion seemed more easy than when the
mother was with them. He walked sedately enough, clinging to one of
his father's soft, white hands, but every so often he ventured a
skip and a jump without being rebuked, and on the whole he felt the
kind of happiness that used to come on Christmas Eve, after the
father had started to distribute the presents.</p>
<p>Keith had frequently accompanied his mother as far as the little
square at the end of the street, and he pointed proudly to the
grocery store where he had helped to buy things.</p>
<p>"Yes," responded the father, and again his tone seemed strangely
unfamiliar to the boy. "I might have had such a store myself, if
luck had been with me."</p>
<p>The idea was more than Keith could digest at once. It was too
overwhelming, and once more he looked at his father with the
feeling of wonder and awe that sometimes took hold of him almost
against his will--a feeling that clashed hopelessly with the
nervous shyness commonly inspired by the father's stern
manners.</p>
<p>"Why didn't you get it," the boy ventured at last.</p>
<p>"Because I was born under the Monkey Star," replied the father
grimly.</p>
<p>The boy wondered what kind of star that was, but still more he
wondered at the father's mood which appeared to indicate a
displeasure not directed at the questioner. Before Keith could ask
anything more, they had started across one of the open market
places that line the fresh-water side of the old City.</p>
<p>The place was empty except for a few closed and abandoned
booths. But at the foot of it lay rows of one-masted sailing
vessels loaded halfway up their masts with piles of fire-wood. In
the background, beyond a small sheet of water crossed by a low iron
bridge, rose abruptly the rocky walls of the South End, with funny
old houses perched precariously along their edges. Keith stared so
hard at all the new things that not a single question had a chance
to escape him before they entered another street and stopped in
front of a stone house that to him looked like a castle.</p>
<p>It had a real portal instead of an ordinary doorway, and the
inside was still more impressive. Keith had been to church once or
twice, and for a moment he thought himself in one. But he saw no
seats, and his father did not look solemn at all. The walls were of
stone curiously streaked and coloured. The ceiling was so far up
that Keith had to bend far backwards to see it. It was full of
ornaments and supported by two rows of tall round stone pillars so
thick that Keith could not get his arms halfway around one of them.
In the background rose a very broad and seemingly endless stairway
of white stone. While they climbed it step by step, Keith wondered
if the king in his palace had anything like it.</p>
<p>Arrived at the top at last, they turned into a sort of lobby--a
rather bare room with several plain desks by the windows and many
hooks along the inner wall. There the father took off both his
coats and armed himself with a huge feather duster and a rag.</p>
<p>"Remember, Keith," he said in his ordinary tone, "that you may
look as much as you please, but that you must not touch anything.
If you do, you can never come here again."</p>
<p>Having passed through several smaller rooms, they emerged
finally into a hall so bright and spacious that Keith stopped with
a gasp and for a moment thought himself in the open air again. It
was as wide as the building itself and three sides were full of
large windows A counter of mahogany that looked miles long ran from
one end to the other. The place behind it contained many desks so
tall that Keith could not have reached the tops of them with his
raised hand. But from a distance he could see that they were full
of tempting things--paper and pens and pencils, red bars of sealing
wax, glue-pots and rulers and glistening shears.</p>
<p>Two men, also in their shirt-sleeves, were busy at the desks,
dusting them and arranging the things on top of them. And the
father quickly went to work in the same way.</p>
<p>It seemed interesting to Keith, who would have liked to try his
hand at it. But it also disconcerting for some reason he could not
explain and for a while he watched the father as if unwilling to
believe his own eyes. Somehow it did not tally with certain notions
formed in Keith's head on the night when the church was burning. At
last he up to his father and asked:</p>
<p>"Is this where you always work?"</p>
<p>"No," was the answer given with a peculiar grimness. "This is
for the officials."</p>
<p>"What are they?"</p>
<p>"Oh, tellers and cashiers and bookkeepers."</p>
<p>Keith noted the words for future inquiries. For the moment they
meant nothing to him.</p>
<p>"Why are you not here too," he persisted.</p>
<p>"Because I am only an attendant--a mere <i>vaktm&auml;stare</i>.
That is a fact you had better fix in your mind once for all, my
boy."</p>
<p>"Is that your little boy, Wellander," one of the other men
called out at that moment. "Let us have a look at him."</p>
<p>Hand-shakings and head-pattings followed as Keith was presented
to "Uncle" This and "Uncle" That. He didn't object and he didn't
care. They looked nice enough, and their talk was friendly, but
somehow he felt that his parents did not care for them. Some of the
glamour had left the place. In spite of its magnificence, he did
not like it, although he was glad to have seen it.</p>
<p>Discovering a wastepaper basket full of envelopes with brightly
coloured marks on them, he regained his interest a little. He knew
those marks for stamps and they had pictures on them which
attracted him very much. So he made a bee-line for the basket and
proceeded to pick out what he liked best.</p>
<p>"Have you forgotten what I told you," he heard his father shout
to him.</p>
<p>"They have been thrown away," he said going toward the
father.</p>
<p>"That is neither here nor there," was the sharp answer he got.
"You know they are not yours, and so you must not touch them. Put
them back at once."</p>
<p>Keith did as he was told, wondering if he really had done
anything wrong or if his father merely objected for some reason of
his own.</p>
<p>Then he walked around uninterested and forlorn until they were
ready to go home again. The stairway seemed shorter as they
descended, but the pillars were tall and thick as before. And on
the way home his father found a little shop open and bought him a
few <i>&ouml;re's</i> worth of hard candy.</p>
<p>It was the only time Keith could ever remember his having done
such a thing.</p>
<br>

<br>
<p>The lodger happened to be away when they got home, and the
mother had opened the door to the parlour in order to get a little
more air and light into the living-room. After dinner the father
went into the parlour to take a nap on the big sofa, while the
mother settled down comfortably in her easy chair, a piece of
handiwork on her lap as usual. Keith took up his customary position
on the footstool to tell her what he had seen and done during his
morning excursion.</p>
<p>She was eager to hear everything and helped him along with
questions, and yet there ran through her very eagerness a subtle
inner resistance which the boy felt vaguely. It as if she never
really cared for anything concerning him in which she herself had
not taken part.</p>
<p>The original glamour had returned to every aspect of his new
experience, and he tried excitedly to describe the wonders of the
vestibule, the stairway and the big hall. In the midst of it he
paused suddenly and fell to staring into vacancy.</p>
<p>"Was that all," she asked, puzzled by his silence.</p>
<p>"Lena dusts our rooms, doesn't she," was his rather startling
counter-question.</p>
<p>"Mostly," the mother replied with a searching glance at his
puckered brows. "Although I sometimes ..."</p>
<p>"You don't have to," the boy broke in.</p>
<p>"No" she admitted, "but then I am sure it is properly done."</p>
<p>"Is that why papa dusts the tables in the bank?"</p>
<p>A pause followed during which it was the mother's turn to stand
the boy's intense scrutiny.</p>
<p>"No," she said at last. "He does it because it is a part of his
work, and a shame it is that he has to. Scrub-women come in and do
the rest of the cleaning, but they are not trusted with the desks,
and so the attendants have to take turns doing that part of it.
That's why your father has to leave so very early in the
morning."</p>
<p>Mother and son lapsed into silence once more. It was broken by
another question from the boy.</p>
<p>"Why couldn't I take some stamps that had been thrown away?"</p>
<p>"Had your father said anything about it before you took
them?"</p>
<p>"He told me not to touch anything."</p>
<p>"Then you couldn't because he had told you to leave things
alone. He is so careful in all such matters. Sometimes he goes a
little too far, perhaps, but you can be sure that he means right.
Other people want the stamps, and there is a lot of gossip and envy
about everything, and he is too proud to be dragged into that sort
of thing. It is always better, Keith, to leave alone what you know
is not your own. Honesty endures beyond all else."</p>
<p>Keith made no direct response, but sprang one more irrelevant
question:</p>
<p>"Why didn't papa get the grocery store?"</p>
<p>"How do you know," the mother demanded with a quick glance at
him.</p>
<p>"Papa told me."</p>
<p>"Well," she drawled as if thinking. Then she settled back in the
chair, her mind made up. "Listen, and I will tell you a story. Once
upon a time there was a rich old man who owned a grocery
store."</p>
<p>"That's where they sell prunes and raisins and sugar," the boy
put in.</p>
<p>"And the store was so fine," she went on unheedingly, "that the
old man was permitted to sell all those things to the king's own
kitchen. The old man had many assistants, but at the head of them
all was a young man who knew just what to do, because he had worked
in such stores ever since he was a little boy. And he was so honest
and able and polite that the people liked him very much and came to
the store for his sake, but the old man liked him more anybody
else."</p>
<p>"Was the old man nice," Keith asked.</p>
<p>"Yes, indeed, but he was also very peculiar, and the most
peculiar thing about him was that he hated all women and thought
that a man who married was lost for ever."</p>
<p>"Did he have any children?"</p>
<p>"No, men who want no wives get no children. That is a part of
their punishment. And so when the owner of the store got older and
older, and began to feel tired, he didn't know to whom he should
leave the store. You may be sure that he thought it over many
times, because he was exceedingly proud of the store and wanted it
to go on. The result of his thinking was that he decided to give it
to the young man whom he trusted and liked so much."</p>
<p>"How did the young man look," Keith broke in.</p>
<p>"Something like your father, I should say. But while all this
was going on, the young man had met a princess and fallen in love
with her...."</p>
<p>"A real princess," asked the boy with wide-open eyes.</p>
<p>"All princesses are real in their own opinion. And she and the
young man had promised to marry each other, and this the old man
learned at last. Then he was very, very angry and told the young
man that he was a fool. And when the young man answered that there
were many of his kind, and that he had pledged his word, the old
man told him that he would not get the store unless he promised to
have nothing more to do with the princess. But the young man loved
her and would not give her up, and so, you see--he didn't get the
store. Don't you think that was nobly done, Keith?"</p>
<p>"Ye-es," the boy assented without particular enthusiasm, "but if
he had got the store, we should have been rich now?"</p>
<p>"We," repeated the mother in a funny tone. "Why, then there
would have been no <i>we</i>."</p>
<p>"Why not," he demanded.</p>
<p>"Or it might have been worse still," she whispered as if
momentarily forgetful of the boy's presence.</p>
<p>"There is your father now," she said a moment later, when a
slight stir was heard in the adjoining room. "Don't say anything
more about the store.... Do you know what your father wanted to be
most of all?"</p>
<p>Keith looked up speculatively as his father appeared at the
doorway to the parlour--a man of medium height, who stooped because
he was nearsighted, and so looked shorter than he was, but also
stronger because of the great width of his shoulders.</p>
<p>"I can tell you," the father put in. "When I couldn't study, I
wanted to be a sailor, and I tried to take hire on a ship whose
master knew me and wished to help me. Then they found out that I
was too nearsighted to steer by the compass, and that was the end
of it. Didn't I tell that I was born under the Monkey Star?"</p>
<p>"Don't talk like that, Carl," the mother protested, rising to
give him a kiss. "You have done very well, and there is no man in
the bank more respected than you."</p>
<p>"Yes," he admitted with something like a grin. "They know I
wouldn't steal even if I had a chance, and they let me collect four
million crowns, as I did the other day, but I shall never get
beyond where I am today. So there you are--what's struck for a
farthing will never be a dollar."</p>
<p>Keith's head was still full of what he had heard when he went to
bed that night, and he didn't know whether to feel happy or unhappy
about it. His father had grown bigger and more interesting in some
ways, and yet the boy's chief impression was of a failure and a
fall. It was this impression that stuck most deeply in his
mind.</p>

<h2><a name="I_XXI"></a>XXI</h2>
<br>
<p>Keith's home was not one of those hospitable places with the
doors always wide open, to which people are drawn almost against
their will and from which they come away with difficulty. Perhaps
it was, above all, the spirit of the father that settled this
matter. To him, more than to any Englishman, his home was his
castle, and he liked to keep the drawbridge raised against
unwelcome company. And most company seemed unwelcome, although at
times, when the right persons appeared at the right moment, he
could be happy as a child and unbend in a manner that made Keith
gape with wonder. When her good mood prevailed, the mother, too,
was touchingly eager for the diversion provided by a chance visit,
but when the dark moments came, she shunned everybody, while at the
same time she watched any prolonged failure to call with morbid
suspiciousness, ascribing it promptly to a sense of superiority
toward herself and her family. Granny was glad enough to talk to
anybody, but she would never ask any one to call, and if no one
came, she was apt to dig out some particularly bitter proverb, like
"money alone has many friends."</p>
<p>Both parents could be hospitable enough when occasion so
demanded, but it was a formal thing with them, exercised only after
due preparation. In many ways, they were large-heartedly generous,
but only in a serious manner, when actual need required it. They
might give freely beyond what they could well afford, but the
father could be out of humour for days if some little thing
regarded as particularly his own had been touched or used by
another member of the family.</p>
<p>As it was, people came and went a good deal, but they came
formally or because some specific errand brought them, and most of
the errands, Keith soon realized, were connected with a desire for
help. The old women living like nightbirds in the garret, would
drop in frequently, and almost invariably with some tale of woe
that sooner or later drew from the mother relief in one form or
another. And one of Keith's earliest tasks, half coveted and half
feared, was to walk up to one of the attics with a plate of soup or
a saucer full of jam or some other tidbit. Others would come from
the outside, and they, too, were mostly old women. They always
wanted to pat Keith, and he objected passionately to all of them.
His especial aversion was a gaunt old woman with a big hooked nose
and a pair of startlingly large, sad-looking eyes. She always
smiled, and her smile was hopelessly out of keeping with the rest
of her face. The very sight of her made Keith forget all his
manners. Time and again his mother rebuked him and tried to bring
him around by telling the old woman's story--a story of wonderful
self-sacrifice and heroic struggle--but it made no difference to
him. There was something about the sight of poverty and unhappiness
and failure that provoked him beyond endurance, and sometimes he
would turn to his mother with a reckless cry of:</p>
<p>"Why do you let them come here at all?"</p>
<p>For the friends of the family, who came there on an equal
footing, he showed more respect, and for a few of them he felt a
real liking. As a rule, however, they inspired him with nothing but
indifference, and his one reason for greeting them with some
approach at cordiality was that they brought a change into the
general monotony of the home, and that their coming might lead to
the distribution of some dainties out of the ordinary. Some of his
parents' friends were poor and growing poorer. Others had the
appearance of doing well and hoping for more. It made no difference
to Keith. They were all middle-aged, sedate and preoccupied with
their own little affairs. They tried to be nice to him, but they
did not interest him, and his main grievance against them--not
clearly understood by any means--was that they brought nothing into
his life of what he wanted.</p>
<p>Had he been asked what he wanted, he would have answered
unhesitatingly:</p>
<p>"Some one to play with."</p>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<h2><a name="I_XXII"></a>XXII</h2>
<br>
<p>Having whined and nagged until his mother no longer could bear
it, Keith at last obtained the cherished permission to go and play
in the lane.</p>
<p>"But look out for horses," warned his mother as he stood in the
doorway ready to run. "And don't run out of sight, and you must
come when I call, and--you had better keep away from other boys, or
you may come home quite naked this time."</p>
<p>"What do you mean," asked Keith, turning to see whether the
mother was joking or talking seriously.</p>
<p>"Don't you recall when those boys took your coat from you, and
you came up here crying?"</p>
<p>There could be no mistake about her meaning just what she said.
Keith stood still thinking very hard. Here was another memory that
he could not remember at all. There was not a trace of it left in
his mind, and yet it must have happened. It sounded exciting, too,
and he wished to know all about it.</p>
<p>"You had better close the door," his mother suggested.</p>
<p>"All right," said Keith, hastening to close the door from the
outside and make a dive for the stairway. There would be plenty of
time to ask about the loss of his coat later. He was halfway down
the first flight when he heard the kitchen door open behind him,
and his heart leapt into his throat.</p>
<p>"You must go down the stairs quietly," his mother called out
from above, whereupon Keith's heart resumed its normal
position.</p>
<p>He descended the rest of that flight on tip-toe. The second one
was taken more rapidly, and down the last one he went two steps at
a time, the little iron plates under his heels hitting the stones
with a ring that echoed through the old house.</p>
<p>In the lane he found them loading a dray in front of the
distillery, and he started across to watch the men straining at the
next barrel. He had hardly taken a step in that direction, however,
when a loud pop was heard from the black cave forming the entrance
to the distillery. It was followed first by a single cry, and then
by a hubbub of voices. A second later a young man came running out
and threw himself prone into the gutter, where a trickle of water
was to be seen.</p>
<p>Keith was too astonished to be frightened at once. He could not
understand what made the man act in this way. Then another man came
out in a rush and began to beat the legs of the man in the gutter
with his hands, and Keith suddenly noticed that little blue flames
were dancing up and down the grimy leathern trousers of the first
man.</p>
<p>The memory of the night when the church burned leaped into his
mind, making him turn instinctively toward the passageway and his
mother's lap.</p>
<p>At that moment a third man appeared carrying a big tank full of
water which he poured over the man in the gutter. The latter got on
his feet and limped back into the distillery, supported by his two
comrades.</p>
<p>Keith was left behind, trembling a little and gazing curiously
at the hanging head of the dray-horse which had not made the
slightest movement during the previous excitement.</p>
<p>"He'll have to go to bed," said a sleepy voice at his shoulder
just then.</p>
<p>Keith swung around as if touched by an electric shock. Before
him he saw another small boy, apparently of his own age, but a
little taller, and light-haired like himself.</p>
<p>"What's your name," asked Keith as soon as he caught his
breath.</p>
<p>"Johan," answered the other stolidly, but not unfriendly.</p>
<p>"Have you got another name like me?"</p>
<p>"My name is Johan Peter Gustafsson," was the reply given in the
tone of a lesson painfully learned.</p>
<p>"Where do you live?"</p>
<p>"Right here."</p>
<p>"Not in our house," Keith protested.</p>
<p>"No, down there," Johan explained, pointing to the little side
door leading into the courtyard of one of the corner houses at the
Quay.</p>
<p>"What's your father?" Keith continued his cross-examination.</p>
<p>"<i>Vaktm&auml;stare</i>" said Johan indifferently.</p>
<p>"So is mine," Keith cried eagerly. "Have you got a bank,
too?"</p>
<p>Johan shook his head as if unable to grasp what Keith meant.</p>
<p>"My popsey works in the office down there," he said, "and we
live beside it, and at night I go with popsey when he carries all
the mail to the postoffice."</p>
<p>"Why do you call him popsey," inquired Keith, fascinated by the
new word and wondering if he would dare use it to his own
father.</p>
<p>"Because that's what he is," Johan declared.</p>
<p>A few minutes later they were playing together as if they had
known each other for ever. They had just discovered an unusually
large and tempting pin in a crack at the bottom of the gutter, when
Keith heard his mother calling from the window above:</p>
<p>"What are you doing, Keith?"</p>
<p>"Oh, just playing," he replied without looking up, forgetful of
everything but the pin that would not come out of the crack.</p>
<p>"Who is that with you?"</p>
<p>"That is Johan," Keith shouted back triumphantly, "and his papa
is a <i>vaktm&auml;stare</i>, too."</p>
<p>"Come right up and let me speak to you," was the insistant
rejoinder from above.</p>
<p>"Oh, please, mamma," the boy pleaded, his voice breaking a
little, "can't I stay just a little longer?"</p>
<p>"You must come at once," his mother commanded.</p>
<p>"Is that your mumsey," Johan asked.</p>
<p>"It is my mamma," Keith retorted, his attention momentarily
diverted by Johan's most peculiar way of referring to his
parents.</p>
<p>"Then you had better go," advised the new friend sagely, "or she
will tell your popsey, and then you know what happens to you."</p>
<p>"I think I can come down again, if you wait for me," cried Keith
as he ran into the long dark passageway.</p>
<p>At that moment a cry of "Johan" rose from the lower part of the
lane, and Keith had to come back once more to look.</p>
<p>"There's my mumsey now," said Johan philosophically, pointing to
an open window on the ground floor of the corner house. With that
he slouched off in a manner that Keith half envied and half
resented.</p>
<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 35%;">
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="I_XXIII"></a>XXIII</h2>
<br>
<p>The sudden emergence of Johan had filled Keith's heart with a
new hope. Here was a possible playmate at last. The fact that his
father was a <i>vaktm&auml;stare</i> like Keith's ought to settle
all paternal opposition, the boy thought. But to his great
surprise, he found this not to be the case.</p>
<p>A severe cross-examination followed his return home. In the
midst of it, Keith made a grievous strategic mistake, lured on by
his insatiable curiosity about strange words.</p>
<p>"Why does Johan call his mamma 'mumsey' and his papa 'popsey,'"
he asked unexpectedly. "It sounds funny."</p>
<p>"Because he does not know any better," his mother rejoined with
unmistakable disapproval. "It doesn't sound nice, and it isn't
nice."</p>
<p>"But his papa and mamma don't care," Keith objected.</p>
<p>"That's the worst of it," said the mother. "It shows they are
not very nice people, and I wish to talk to your father before you
can play with Johan any more."</p>
<p>"I have heard of them," the grandmother piped up, making them
both turn towards her, one hopefully and the other doubtfully.</p>
<p>The grandmother never left the kitchen. She walked from the sofa
to the big foot-stool, from the foot-stool to the table by the
window, and from the table back to the sofa. Sometimes she would
not be seen talking to another person for days. And yet she had a
miraculous way of surprising the rest of the family with pieces of
gossip picked out of the air, one might think. There was apparently
not a person in the neighbourhood of whom she had not heard, and
about whom she could not give some more or less intimate piece of
information. They were all perfect strangers to her, but she
followed their lives with as much keenness for minute details as if
they had been her nearest kin or dear friends.</p>
<p>"She was a cook in the house of the man whose office Gustafsson
works in," the grandmother went on. "He used to do odd jobs for the
family, cutting wood and such things, and in that way he met her in
the kitchen, and one fine day they decided to get married. She is
older than him, and I guess it was her last chance. But the family
was crazy about her, and when they heard of it, they gave him the
place of attendant in the office downstairs and the two rooms back
of the office to live in. He was just a peasant boy, and she reads
the Bible all day and goes to prayer-meeting at night."</p>
<p>"How do you know all that," wondered Keith's mother, having
learned by this time that the old woman's gossip was generally well
founded on truth.</p>
<p>"Oh," the grandmother said with a queer smile particular to such
occasions, "a little bird sang it to me."</p>
<p>"I think they must be rather low people," Keith's mother
concluded.</p>
<p>"Perhaps," the grandmother said, "but they have plenty of
religion at least, and I don't think the boy can do much harm to
Keith."</p>
<p>Keith ran up to the grandmother and kissed her impulsively.</p>
<p>That night there was a great family council. Keith's father was
told about Johan and the Gustafssons.</p>
<p>"I think they are about as good as ourselves," was his verdict,
given in a tone suggesting contempt for his own position rather
than respect for that of Johan's father. "But Keith has his toys,
and that ought to be enough for him."</p>
<p>"It <i>is</i> rather lonely for him," the mother rejoined, "and
he should get out a little, I suppose, but I hate to have him
playing about the streets, and I fear Johan's manners are not very
good."</p>
<p>"The best thing is to send him to school," said the father.</p>
<p>"What are you talking of, Carl," the mother cried. "The
idea--when he is barely five!"</p>
<p>"He knows more about the letters than I did when I began school
at seven," the father came back unperturbed.</p>
<p>"I don't think it would be very bad for him to play a little
with Johan now and then," said the mother evasively, bending down
to kiss Keith, who had snuggled up to her during the preceding
talk. Then she put her hand through his waves of almost flaxen
hair, bent his head slightly backward, looked straight into his
eyes, and asked:</p>
<p>"You don't want to leave me, do you?"</p>
<p>"No," said Keith, hugging her passionately, "but I think I
should like to go to school."</p>
<p>The idea carried no distinct image to his mind, and he felt a
little timid toward all those unknown possibilities implied by the
word school, but this slight feeling of hesitation was swamped by a
longing so restless and so irresistible that it sent tears to his
eyes, although he could not tell himself what it was he longed
for.</p>
<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 35%;">
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="I_XXIV"></a>XXIV</h2>
<br>
<p>It was true that Keith knew a good deal for his age. In fact, he
had mastered the whole alphabet and was making good progress in
spelling under his mother's guidance. He was eager and quick to
learn. Generally his interest was rather fitful, but along this one
line it showed no wavering. It was as if the boy had known that the
art of reading would offer him an escape of some sort.</p>
<p>He might have advanced still more rapidly if his mother had been
more steady in her teaching. She was very proud of him, and she
spoke of reading and studying as if there were nothing finer in the
world.</p>
<p>"No better burden bears any man than much wisdom," she quoted
one day from the old Eddas--probably without knowing the source. "I
know, if any one does, what lack of money means, but I want you
rather to have learning than wealth. Then, when the whole world is
listening to you with bated breath, I shall walk across North
Bridge resting on your arm, and I shall be repaid for all that my
own life has not brought me. We shall walk arm in arm, you and I,
at four o'clock, when the King goes for a walk, too, and all
Stockholm is there to see.... Will you do that, Keith?"</p>
<p>"Of course," he cried, his eyes shining.</p>
<p>But sometimes she was helpless in the grip of one of her
depressed moods, and then days might go by without a lesson. Far
from being made happy by that respite, he would plead with her to
be taught "one more little letter," and finally she would bring
down the book from the hanging book shelf on the wall back of her
easy chair. There stood the a-b-c book she had bought for him, and
her favourite hymn-book, and the New Testament given to the father
when he left school to begin earning his own living, and the
miniature copy of Luther's catechism presented to him at the time
of his confirmation. There, too, rested the big Bible which Keith's
mother treasured as much as her wedding ring and the bureau that
was her chief wedding present. It was a gift from her father when
she was confirmed, and on its fly-leaf he had written:</p>
<p>"Belongs to Anna Margareta Carlsson."</p>
<p>It was this Bible rather than the a-b-c book that became the
principal means of instruction. Keith loved it, and he could not
have been much more than three years old when he first began to
pore over its quaint old illustrations. The first of these showed
an old man with a long beard and a trailing white garment floating
over a sheet of water out of which rose two ragged pieces of rock.
At one corner a pallid sun emerged out of the fleeing mists, while,
at the opposite corner, a tiny moon crescent seemed about to
disappear beneath the stilled waters.</p>
<p>"Who is that," asked Keith not once, but many times.</p>
<p>"That is God creating the world," explained his mother.</p>
<p>"But I don't see the world."</p>
<p>"It is just coming out," she said, pointing to the rocks.</p>
<p>"Who's God," was Keith's next question as a rule.</p>
<p>"He is the father of the whole universe," the mother said
reverently.</p>
<p>"Papa's too," asked the boy once, and seeing his mother nod
assent, he cried jubilantly:</p>
<p>"Then he must be my grandfather, whose portrait you haven't
got!"</p>
<p>More frequently he stopped short as soon as he heard about the
universal fatherhood. That was grown-up talk to him, and like much
else, it carried no meaning to his mind. Nor did he waste much
thought on it after having asked once if he could see God and been
told that no man could do that and live. His mind was occupied with
food and clothes and toys and people and things. What could never
be seen was easily dismissed--much more easily than the spook that
one of the servant girls insisted on having seen, thus making
Keith's father so angry that he nearly discharged her on the spot.
And from that first picture in the Bible the boy turned impatiently
to another further on, where a small boy with a sword almost as big
as himself was cutting the head off a man much taller than Keith's
father. And at the top of each page appeared big black letters
which he could recognize almost as easily as those in the a-b-c
book, although they were differently shaped and much more pretty to
look at.</p>
<p>To Keith this opening up of a new world was exclusively pleasant
at first, and so it was to his mother, but other people seemed to
be troubled by it at times. One day his free-spoken aunt was
visiting with them, and, as usual, disagreeing with Keith's mother,
who evidently felt one of her dark spells approaching. Wishing to
express her disagreement at some particular point quite forcibly,
but wishing also to keep the listening boy from enriching his
vocabulary with a term of doubtful desirability, she took the
precaution to spell out the too picturesque word:</p>
<p>"R-o-t!" Just then she caught a gleam of aroused interest in
Keith's eyes, and to make assurance doubly sure, she hastened to
add: "Says rod!"</p>
<p>"No," Keith objected promptly. "It says rot, and I want to know
what it means."</p>
<p>"I knew that small pigs also have ears, but I didn't know they
could spell," was her amused comment, uttered in a tone that
touched something in Keith's inside most pleasantly. Then, however,
she went on in a manner grown quite serious:</p>
<p>"You had better send him to school, Anna."</p>
<p>"Yes," replied the mother to Keith's intense surprise, "Carl and
I have been talking it over and practically decided to do so. He
certainly needs some better guidance than he gets from his poor,
good-for-nothing mother."</p>
<p>"Good-for-nothing fiddlesticks!" sputtered the aunt. "You'll
make me say something much worse than rot. Anna, if you keep
talking like that when the boy hears it."</p>
<p>Keith had heard, but his mind was absorbed by the new idea.</p>
<p>"Well," said his mother, "I cannot take care of him properly. He
is running down to that Gustafsson boy all time and most of the
time I can't get him home again except by going for him."</p>
<p>"Johan's mother said yesterday that I hadn't been there half an
hour when you called for me," Keith broke in. "And then she said
that I had better not come back if you don't think Johan good
enough for to play with."</p>
<p>"I don't say we are better than anybody else," said the mother,
addressing herself to the aunt rather than to Keith. "But I don't
know what he is doing when he is down there, and Johan seems such a
clod that I can't see why Keith wants to play with him."</p>
<p>"Why can't Johan come up here," asked Keith.</p>
<p>"Because ...," said his mother, and got no further.</p>
<p>"Yes," the aunt declared in a tone of absolute finality, "you
must send him to school."</p>
<p>No sooner had the aunt taken her leave than Keith assailed his
mother with excited demands for further information. She took his
head between her both hands and looked at him as if she would never
see him again.</p>
<p>"Only five," she said at last, "and already he wants to get
away. A few years more--a few short years--and you will be gone for
good, I suppose."</p>
<p>"Oh, mamma," he protested, "you know that I shall never leave
you!"</p>
<p>"No, never entirely," she cried, kissing him fervently. "Promise
me you won't, Keith!"</p>
<p>He promised, and then he wanted to know what they did in school.
But she began to talk about difficulties and dangers and
temptations and all sorts of things he couldn't grasp. She spoke
with intense feeling, and as always when she was deeply moved, his
whole being was set vibrating in tune with her mood. His cheeks
flushed, his throat choked, his eyes brimmed over with tears, and
at last he began to wonder whether he had not better stay right
where he was. Her eyes were dim with tears, too, and once more she
took his head between her hands and looked an endless time before
she said:</p>
<p>"Now you are beginning life in earnest, Keith!"</p>

<br>
<p>One day in the early autumn Keith's mother dressed him with
unusual care and kissed him several times before they left the
house. Granny had to be kissed, too, and even Lena came forward to
shake hands and say good-bye. It was a very solemn affair.</p>
<p>Hand in hand Keith and his mother walked clear across the old
City, past Great Church, until they came to a very broad lane at
the foot of which was a square with a statue in it. At the other
end of the square lay a very large, red building.</p>
<p>"That's the House of Knights where all the nobility hang up
their coats-of-arms," said the mother.</p>
<p>But Keith was too excited to ask any questions at that
moment.</p>
<p>They entered a house much finer and neater than their own and
stopped in front of a door on the second floor. A hubbub of shrill
voices could be heard from within. Keith gripped his mother's hand
more firmly.</p>
<p>Then the door was opened by a white-haired lady with spectacles
and they were admitted to a large room, containing a score of
little boys and girls. A dead silence fell on the room as they
appeared, and every eye turned toward Keith, who blushed furiously
as was his wont whenever he found himself observed.</p>
<p>After a brief talk with the teacher, Keith's mother to him:</p>
<p>"This is Aunt Westergren, whom you must obey as you obey me. And
now be a good boy and don't cry."</p>
<p>As the mother tarried by the door for a moment to exchange a
last word with the teacher, and perhaps also to cast one more
lingering glance at the boy, a little girl ran up to Keith, put her
right fore-finger on top of his head and cried out:</p>
<p>"Towhead!"</p>
<p>All the other children giggled. Keith blushed more deeply than
ever, but did not say a word or stir a limb. A moment later the
teacher began to cross-question him about his knowledge of letters
and spelling, and he found it much easier to answer her than to
face the children. But, of course, after a while he was quite at
home among them without knowing how it had happened.</p>
<p>That afternoon his mother came for him. The next morning he had
to start out alone under direct orders from the father, and alone
he made his way home again, his bosom swelling with a sense of
wonderful independence. Years passed before he learned that his
mother had watched over him for days before she was fully convinced
of his ability to find the way by himself.</p>
<p>The autumn passed. Winter and spring came and went. It was
summer again. The little school closed. Keith could read the
head-lines at the tops of the pages in the big Bible without help.
But of the school where he had learned it hardly a memory remained.
It was as if the place had made no impression whatsoever on his
mind. And the children with whom he studied and played nearly a
whole year might as well have been dreams, forgotten at the moment
of waking--all but one of them.</p>
<p>Harald alone seemed a real, living thing, a part of Keith's own
life, but not a part of the school where the two met daily. He was
a year older than Keith, a little slow mentally, but rather
unusually advanced in other ways. His father was a merchant of some
sort, with an office of his own and half a dozen clerks at his
command, and Harald had been taught to regard himself as a young
gentleman. They lived a few houses from the school, in the same
street, and their home was a revelation to Keith.</p>
<p>Houses less fortunate than his own were familiar to him, but he
had never seen a better one until he was asked to visit Harald for
the first time, and the comparisons made on that occasion stuck
deeply in his mind.</p>
<p>They entered through a hallway where caps and coats were left
behind, and from there they went into a room where every piece of
furniture was of mahogany. Between the windows hung a mirror in a
gilded frame that was as tall as the room itself, so that Keith
could see himself from head to foot. The object that caught the
boy's attention most of all, however, was a chandelier suspended
from the middle of the ceiling and made up of hundreds of little
rods of glass. As Harald slammed the door on entering, some of the
rods were set in motion and struck against each other with a tiny
twinkle that seemed to Keith the most beautiful sound he had ever
heard.</p>
<p>That room, Harald said, was used only to receive visitors, and
he gave Keith to understand that there were any number of other
rooms on both sides of it. One of these was Harald's own and used
by nobody else. He could even lock the door of it on the inside, if
he wanted. There they played with tin soldiers several inches high,
and Harald had a little cannon out of which they could shoot dry
peas, so that it was possible to fight a real battle by dividing
the soldiers and taking turns of using the cannon. Finally Harald's
mother appeared with a bowl of fruit and greeted the visitor with a
certain searching kindness that made him a little uneasy in the
midst of all his enjoyment.</p>
<p>Keith returned home that day much later than unusual to find his
mother in a state of frantic worry. At first she declared that he
must not go anywhere without her knowing about it in advance, but
after a while she became quite interested and palpably elated by
Keith's tale of all the glories he had seen. She explained that the
glass rods on the chandeliers were prisms that showed the whole
rainbow when you held them in front of a light, and she asked him
eagerly if he had been invited to come again. But when the father
heard of it that night, he said:</p>
<p>"I don't think Keith should go there at all. He can't ask such a
boy over here, and the next thing we know, Keith's own home will no
longer be good enough for him."</p>
<p>Keith could hardly believe his ears. He had never felt such
resentment against his father, and just before going to bed, while
his father was out of the room for a moment, he whispered to his
mother:</p>
<p>"I think papa does not want me to have any fun!"</p>
<p>"You don't understand," she retorted. "He means well. Remember
what Granny says: Equals make the best playmates."</p>
<p>Three or four times Keith went home with Harald. Then the gates
of paradise were suddenly slammed in his face. One day, as they
were leaving school together, Harald remarked quite calmly:</p>
<p>"You can't come home with me any more."</p>
<p>"Why," gasped Keith, his throat choking.</p>
<p>"Because mamma says I must find some one else to play with,"
Harald explained. Then he softened a little: "I can't help it, and
I like you."</p>
<p>"But why," insisted Keith on the verge of tears.</p>
<p>"You look like a nice boy, mamma says, but your father is
nothing but a <i>vaktm&auml;stare</i>, and mine is a
<i>grosshandlare</i> (wholesale dealer)."</p>
<p>Keith walked home in a stupor and began to cry the moment he saw
his mother. Her lips tightened and her face grew white as she
listened to the story he sobbed forth.</p>
<p>"Now you can see that your father was right," she said at last.
"Of course, we are just as good as anybody else, but others don't
think so--because we are poor. But we have our pride, and you had
better stay and play with your own soldiers hereafter. Then I don't
have to worry about you either."</p>
<p>But Keith had very little pride. He continued to seek Harald's
company as before, and twice, as they about to part in front of the
latter's house, Keith asked if he couldn't come up and play for a
little while.</p>
<p>"Don't you understand," Harald asked the second time, "that my
mamma does not think you good enough for me to play with?"</p>
<p>Keith had not thought of it in that way. He had learned that
there were people who looked down on his parents, just as they, in
their turn, looked down on the parents of Johan, but the idea that
he himself might be regarded equally inferior was entirely new to
him. It was so strange to him that it took him years to grasp it.
And when it came into his mind, he felt as if some one had raised a
heavy stick to strike him, and he cowered under the impending
blow.</p>
<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 35%;">

<br>
<p>Christmas was approaching.</p>
<p>The days grew shorter and shorter, until at last a scant four
hours of daylight remained around noon. Even then a lamp was often
needed for reading.</p>
<p>The lead-coloured sky nearly touched the roofs. The drizzle that
filled the air most of the time seemed to enter men's minds, too,
sapping their vigour until life became a burden. Meeting on the
streets, they would cry in irritable tones:</p>
<p>"When will the snow come?"</p>
<p>It was always a tedious time for Keith. The incident with Harald
made it worse this year. Except for the daily attendance at school,
he was virtually a prisoner. Johan was to be seen only from the
window, whence Keith enviously watched him prowling about the lane,
his hands buried in the side-pockets of an old coat much too
long--apparently inherited from someone else--and his shoulders
hunched as if fore-destined to support loads of wood like those his
father used to carry. If no one was in the living-room, Keith might
shout a greeting to his playmate below, but it was not much fun,
and Johan had a contemptuous way of asking why he did not come out
and play.</p>
<p>Yet the season was not without its compensations. Stores of
every kind were laid in to last through the winter. One might have
thought that a severance of communications with the outside world
was feared. Keith marvelled at the magnificence of it, and once in
a while he asked why it had to be done. The answers were
unsatisfactory. The main reason was that it had always been done,
but he gathered also that, while it was perfectly respectable to
live from day to day during the summer, to do so during the winter
would be a distinct proof of social and economic inferiority.</p>
<p>The fire wood came first--a mighty load of birch logs piled
along the house front in the lane. Two men were busy all day with
saw and ax, reducing those logs into pieces matching the
fire-places in the kitchen stove and the two glazed brick ovens in
the living-room and the parlour. Two more men piled the pieces into
huge sacks and staggered with those on their backs up the five
flights of stairs to the top garret under the peak of the house,
which belonged to the Wellanders.</p>
<p>Keith would stand in the kitchen door watching them. First he
heard the slow clamp-clamp of ascending foot-steps. Then the man's
heavy breathing became audible, and Keith felt as if the load was
resting on his own shoulders. Finally the open top of the bag, with
its bright stuffing of newly cut birch wood, showed at the corner
of the landing quite a long time before the head beneath it came
into sight. As the man crossed the landing in front of Keith, bent
almost double under his burden, a dew of pungent perspiration would
drop on the slate-coloured stones, leaving behind a curious path of
round spots. Not a word was said at that time, but coming down the
men would sometimes throw a crude jest to the bright-eyed watcher
or stop to refill their mouths with snuff out of a little thin
brass box with a mirror fitted to the inside of its cover. The
sight of the snuff filled Keith with a sense of loathing, although
his father used to put a pinch of it into his nostrils now and
then, and more than anything else it seemed to mark a distinction
between himself and those people from a world far beneath his own.
Theirs was a racking job, heavier than any other known to the boy,
and one day he asked his mother:</p>
<p>"Why do they care to carry all that wood for us?"</p>
<p>"Because we pay them, and because they are mighty glad to get
the money. Otherwise they couldn't live."</p>
<p>"And where does the wood come from?"</p>
<p>"The bank sends it as part of papa's pay."</p>
<p>Once more Keith was so impressed with the miraculous power of
that mysterious being which his father served and cursed and
worshipped that his mother's previous answer was lost for the time
being. But it recurred to his mind later and connected with his
father's talk of making him a carpenter. A strong prejudice against
manual labour was shaping itself in his mind.</p>
<p>After the wood came the victuals: a tub of butter reaching Keith
to the chin; bags of flour; barrels of potatoes and apples; hams
and haunches of dried mutton and smoked reindeer meat; and lastly
packages of smaller size and sundry contents that the mother
promptly carried to the pantry inside the parlour without letting
Keith touch them.</p>
<p>This year--it was the winter following the Franco-Prussian
war--the preparations were rendered uncommonly impressive by the
addition of a cheese large as the moon at full. There was always
plenty of cheese of various kinds in the house: whole milk cheese
carefully aged until its flavour was like that of English Stilton
or Italian Gorgonzola; skim milk cheese stuffed with cloves and
cardamom seeds; and dark brown goat milk cheese of a cloying
sweetness that Keith detested.</p>
<p>Cheese was more than a taste with Keith's father. It was a
hobby, and one of his few pastimes was to skirmish in strange
little shops for some particularly old and strong-smelling piece at
a reasonable price. When he brought home a bargain of that kind, he
acted like a bibliophile having just captured a rare first edition
for a song, and the mother tried hard to share his enthusiasm. But,
she said once, she had to draw the line at cheese that walked by
itself. Half in jest and half in earnest, the father maintained
that the maggots were the very essence of the cheese, and that to
remove them was to lose the finest flavour. This year the father
had bought a whole fresh cheese in order to age it at home and thus
save money in two ways, the price being proportionate to the
age.</p>
<p>The same large-handed system prevailed in other things, though
the parents often spoke of their poverty, and though their
resources undoubtedly were very limited. Shirts, table-ware,
bed-linen, china, etc., must needs be acquired in round numbers. To
have less than a dozen of anything was to have nothing at all. The
breaking of a cup was a family disaster if it could not be
replaced. Everything had to be in sets, and to preserve these
intact, the utmost care was preached and exercised. It bred thrift
and orderliness, but also an undue regard for property.</p>
<p>Finally came the time for baking and other direct preparations
for a holiday season that in the good old days used to last from
Christmas Eve to January 13th known as the Twentieth Christmas Day,
when everybody "danced the Yule out." What interested Keith most in
this part of the proceedings was the making of gingersnaps
according to a recipe transmitted to his mother from bygone
generations and cherished by her as a precious family secret. A
whole day was set aside for the purpose and at the end of it they
had a big, bulging earthen jar filled to the brim. Keith used to
boast to other children of those dainties that, in addition to
their taste, had the fascination of many different shapes--hearts,
crowns, lilies, clubs, diamonds, baskets, and so on. They really
deserved all the praise they got, and he had so little to boast of
on the whole. The jar stood on the floor in the pantry back of the
parlour, and once in a while Keith found his way to it without
maternal permission, although, as a rule, he was little given to
lawbreaking.</p>
<p>One morning three or four days before Christmas Lena was heard
calling from the kitchen:</p>
<p>"Keith, Keith, come and look!"</p>
<p>Eager as always when the slightest excitement was promised, the
boy started so suddenly that his little table was upset with its
whole population of tin soldiers and his mother was moved to remark
that "it was no use behaving as if the house were on fire."</p>
<p>"Look at the snow," said Lena, pointing to the window when Keith
reached the kitchen, relieved at not having had to pick up the
spilled toys before he could go.</p>
<p>Huge, wet, feathery flakes were dropping lazily from the sky.
Little by little they increased in numbers and fell more quickly.
At last they formed a moving veil through which the building at the
other end of the courtyard could barely be seen.</p>
<p>Later in the day Keith was permitted to look out through one of
the front windows. The whole world had changed and looked much
brighter in spite of the failing light. The Quay was covered by a
carpet of white that made the waters beyond look doubly dark and
cold. The trees on the opposite shore looked as if they had been
painted from the topmost twig to the root. Down in the lane, two of
the workers in the distillery were pelting each other with
snowballs while a third one was shouting at the top of his
voice:</p>
<p>"We'll have a white Christmas this year, thank heaven."</p>
<p>That same evening Keith's long cherished dream of visiting the
open-air Christmas Fair at Great Square was to come true at last.
Like other affairs of its kind, it had been reduced by the modern
shop to a mere shadow of its former glorious self, and it was kept
up only out of regard for ancient tradition. Keith had been told
that it was nothing but a lot of open booths displaying cheap toys
and cheaper candy. To Keith toys were toys and candy candy, no
matter what the price and quality, and so he kept on begging leave
to go, until the night in question his parents, who were going out
with friends, deemed it better to let him see for himself. And so
Lena was ordered to take charge of the expedition.</p>
<p>Lena and Keith were dressed and ready to start when the mother
came into the kitchen to give the boy a farewell kiss as usual. He
was in high spirits, but fidgety with some unexpressed wish.</p>
<p>"What is it, Keith," asked the mother, recognizing the
symptoms.</p>
<p>"I want some money," he whispered into her ear.</p>
<p>"Go and ask papa."</p>
<p>"No, you ask him."</p>
<p>That was what always happened, and in the end the mother voiced
the boy's plea to the father, who just then appeared in the door to
the living-room. He was in a good humour and promptly reached into
his pocket. Unfortunately Keith discovered at that crucial moment
that one of his shoe laces had become untied.</p>
<p>"Please, mamma, help me," he said, putting his foot on a chair
to enable her to reach it more easily.</p>
<p>"That settles it," exclaimed the father with a darkening face as
he handed Keith a few small copper coins. "That is all you will get
now. A boy of five who makes his mother tie his shoe strings ought
not to have anything at all."</p>
<p>Keith took the coins silently and went with Lena to the fair,
but he saw nothing worth seeing, and he never wanted to go again.
Uneasily he prowled among the booths trying as a matter of duty to
find something so cheap that his scant hoard would buy it. At last
he succeeded in getting a little box of tin soldiers of poorest
quality for one-third less than the price put on it It was one of
the few times in his life when he found himself able to haggle over
the cost of a thing.</p>
<p>From the first he found fault with the new addition to his army,
and one day not long afterwards he charged the whole regiment with
cowardice in the face of the enemy. A drumhead court martial was
held on the spot, and the verdict was a foregone conclusion. The
culprits were found guilty in a body and sentenced to immediate
execution. Then Keith possessed himself surreptitiously of the
family hammer, and when his mother came to investigate the noise he
was making the whole offensive regiment had been reduced to scraps.
Never before or after did Keith as a general go to such extremes on
behalf of military morale.</p>
<p>But many, many years later, when he stopped for the first time
at a typical English hotel, he found himself horribly embarrassed
by the assistance forced on him by the obligatory valet.</p>
<br>
<br>

<h2><a name="II_III"></a>III</h2>
<br>
<p>In Sweden the principal celebration with its distribution of
gifts takes place late on Christmas Eve.</p>
<p>Long before that day Keith began to watch every package brought
into the house. Soon he noticed several that disappeared quickly
without having been opened. Nor did it take his shrewd little mind
long to figure out that they must have been stowed away on the
upper shelf of the pantry back of the parlour. This was an
excellent hiding-place because the shelf in question was fully six
feet above the floor and on a level with the lintel of the doorway,
so that its contents seemed as much out of reach as they were out
sight from below.</p>
<p>One day, however, Keith succeeded in getting into the parlour
when both parents were out. The night before his father had come
home with an unusually large and queerly shaped package under his
arm and had taken it straight into the parlour. The boy's curiosity
was at fever heat and got the better of his customary inertia in
the face of explicit prohibitions. Having dragged a heavy wooden
chair into the pantry, he placed its tall back directly against the
shelves. The crosspieces in the back of the chair formed rungs on
which he climbed up to the top shelf. It was quite a feat for a
very small boy, but the slight timidity that characterized him as a
rule was totally forgotten for the time.</p>
<p>There was the mystifying package together with many others. He
could even touch it with his hand. In spite of its size, it was
very light. It was wider at the bottom than at the top, and it
sounded hollow when he knocked at it. His little brain worked at
high pressure, but not a guess came out of it that was at all
plausible. Finally Keith had to climb down no wiser than he was
before. His failure had one advantage. It freed him from all of
guilt. It served also to keep his expectations at an unusually high
pitch, so that when the morning of the great day arrived at last,
it seemed as if he were facing twelve long hours of actual
torture.</p>
<p>Every one was very busy preparing not only for the feast of the
evening, but for the two coming holidays. Christmas Day in Sweden
being followed by a Second Christmas Day, equal to the first one in
leisure if not in sanctity. No one had any time to spare for the
boy, who found himself in the way wherever he turned. In the end he
was ordered pointblank out of the kitchen, where his mother, Granny
and the servant girl needed all the space at their disposal. The
door to the parlour was closed although the lodger had left town
for the holidays, and so nothing but the living-room remained.
There Keith whiled away the long hours in vain speculation on the
contents of the mysterious package.</p>
<p>He tried to recall what things he had wished for during the
year. He felt sure that nothing of the kind could be in the
package. Any desire openly expressed was disregarded by his father,
Keith thought, if not actually resented. The reason given was that
a Christmas present should be a complete surprise, and if the
recipient had openly asked for it, there could be no talk of
surprising him. Of course, Keith could whisper what he wanted into
his mother's ear now and then but always with the provision that
she must convey the proper information to the father as coming from
herself.</p>
<p>Even this process of elimination failed, however, and so the day
dragged on interminably, with no help from without for a mind weary
of waiting. The customary dinner was passed up. Everybody snatched
a bite off the kitchen table without breaking away from the work.
Three or four times people arrived with packages from relatives or
friends. Each visitor had to be treated, even though he be a
stranger of the humblest character. Then dull monotony reigned once
more, and Keith resumed his fidgeting back and forth between the
kitchen door and his own corner. The old toys were simply
unendurable....</p>
<p>It had long been dark when the father returned home at last,
laden with parcels and tired out by personal delivery of Christmas
gifts to the various members of the family. His face was slightly
flushed and he talked with unusual eagerness. An atmosphere of
reckless good-will surrounded him, and when he made a remark about
there being no presents, even Keith knew it to be facetious.</p>
<p>The last hour was the longest. The father and the mother had
withdrawn to the parlour and closed the door behind them. The girl
was setting the table and couldn't be disturbed. Granny was nervous
and irritable because she knew that she would be forced to join the
rest at the table that night. Keith felt like a disembodied soul
let loose in infinite space without goal or purpose.</p>
<p>Toward eight o'clock the parlour door opened and Keith was
called in. A tiny Christmas tree stood on a table in a corner,
glistening with lights and multicoloured paper festoons. It
represented a great concession, because neither one of the parents
cared much for the trouble involved. If there had been a number of
children in the family, they said, then it would have been another
matter. The truth was that Keith didn't care very much either. He
clapped hands and shouted excitedly, of course, but his glances
went sideways to the big sofa, where stood a huge hamper piled to
twice its own height with parcels, all wrapped in snow-white paper
and sealed with red sealing wax. The air of the room was charged
with the rich smell of newly melted wax, and to Keith that smell
was always the essence of Christmas, its chief symbol and
harbinger.</p>
<p>During those few minutes in the parlour a dozen tall candles had
been lighted in the living-room, transforming the place that a
moment before seemed so dreary. The dining table was opened to its
full length and placed across the middle of the room, at right
angles to the chaiselongue where Keith slept nights. Cut glass
dishes and silver-ware shone in the light reflected from the
spotlessly white table cloth. In the centre stood the Christmas
layer cake, its body four inches thick and its top glistening with
red and yellow and green pieces of candied fruit.</p>
<p>Then began the little comedy regularly enacted every
Christmas.</p>
<p>"Isn't Granny coming," the father asked. Then he turned to Lena.
"Tell her we are ready."</p>
<p>"She says she doesn't want to come in," Lena reported after a
hasty visit to the kitchen.</p>
<p>"You go and ask her for me, Keith," was the father's next
suggestion.</p>
<p>"Thank you, dear," Granny said when Keith came to her with his
message. "But you tell your father that I think the kitchen is a
much better place for a useless old hag like myself."</p>
<p>"Suppose you go," the father said to his wife on hearing Keith's
modified version of Granny's reply.</p>
<p>"She says she really won't come in," the mother explained a
minute later. "You had better go out and ask her yourself, Carl. It
is the one thing she cannot resist."</p>
<p>The father went with a broad grin on his face. Keith laughed
loudly and nervously, his eyes on the huge cake. But the mother
said apologetically to Lena:</p>
<p>"Mamma is so funny about coming in here, although she knows how
much we want her."</p>
<p>"Here she is now," said Lena.</p>
<p>And the father appeared with Granny on his arm, and Granny was
all dressed up in her best skirt of black silk thick as cloth, with
a cap of black lace on her head.</p>
<p>"Really, I can't see what you want with an old thing like me in
here," she continued protesting as she was being led to her seat
beside Keith. The girl sat opposite Granny, and the mother beside
the girl, facing Keith. The father, on that one occasion, always
occupied the chaiselongue at the short end of the table, with the
mother on his right and Keith on his left. Beside him stood the
hamper with its mountainous pile of parcels.</p>
<p>Keith said grace with folded hands and bent head, and, of
course, he had to say it twice because the first time he swallowed
half the words in his eagerness to get through quickly. Then the
meal began.</p>
<p>It opened with a light <i>sm&ouml;rgasbord</i>, hors d'oeuvres,
literally rendered sandwich-table: caviar, anchovy, sardines,
shavings of smoked salmon, slices of bologna, and so on. With it
the father took a <i>snaps</i> of Swedish gin or
<i>br&auml;nnvin</i>, and after much pressing Granny consented to
take one, too. The main course consisted of <i>lutfisk</i>: dried
and salted codfish that had been soaked in water for twenty-four
hours to take out the salt and then boiled until it was tender as
cranberry jelly. It was served with boiled potatoes and a gravy
made of cream and chopped hard-boiled eggs. It was followed by
<i>risgrynsgr&ouml;t</i>: rice cooked in milk and served with a
cover of sugar and cinnamon. Wherever Swedes go, they must have
those two dishes on Christmas Eve. They have had them since the
days when Christmas was a pagan celebration of the winter solstice,
when dried codfish was the staple winter food, and when rice was
the rarest of imported delicacies.</p>
<p>Keith did not become interested until the rice appeared and the
father declared that no one could taste it until he or she had
"rhymed over the rice." Lena had to begin, and blushingly she
read:</p>
<p>"To cook rice is a great feat, especially to get it sweet."</p>
<p>Whereupon everybody applauded, and the mother followed:</p>
<p>"Those who don't like rice are worse than little mice."</p>
<p>The father made them all laugh by saying:</p>
<p>"The rice is sweet and looks very neat, but now I want to
eat."</p>
<p>The cutting of the cake, with its coating of sugar and its many
layers of custard ... the wine, port and sherry, poured from tall
glass decanters with silver labels hung about their necks to show
which was which ... the blushing native apples and the figs from
distant sunlit shores ... the almonds and raisins that tested best
when eaten together ... the candy and the caramels ... the absence
of restraint and reproof ... the freedom to indulge one's utmost
appetite ... the smiles and the pleasant words and the jokes sprung
by the father ... and in the midst of it all a pause laden with
rose-coloured melancholy....</p>
<p>"Why can it not be Christmas every day," asked Keith
suddenly.</p>
<p>"Because Christmas then would be like any other day," the father
replied, reaching for the first parcel which was always for
Keith.</p>
<p>One by one they were handed out. Each one was elaborately
addressed and furnished with a rhymed or unrhymed tag that often
hid a sting beneath its clownish exterior. The father read the
inscription aloud before he handed each parcel to its recipient,
who had to open it and let its contents be admired by all before
another gift was distributed.</p>
<p>The table became crowded. The floor was a litter of paper. Lena
giggled. Granny's cap was down on one ear. Keith could not sit
still on his chair.</p>
<p>"To Master Keith Wellander," the father read out. "A friendly
warning, to be remembered in the morning and all through the day.
He who slops at meals is a pig that squeals and hurts his parents
alway."</p>
<p>Keith took the parcel with less than usual zest. It was
rectangular and very heavy. For a moment he hesitated to open it.
There was something about its inscription that puzzled and bothered
him.</p>
<p>At last the wrapper came off, and he gazed uncomprehendingly at
a large piece of wood hollowed out like a canoe.</p>
<p>"A boat ..." he stammered.</p>
<p>"A trough," rejoined his father, a strange, almost embarrassed
look appearing on his face. "This is Christmas and I want you to be
happy, but you must learn to eat decently, and I thought this might
serve you as a lesson and a reminder."</p>
<p>Keith said nothing. He sat looking at that piece of wood as if
it were a dragon that had swallowed the whole Christmas in a single
gulp. He wanted to cry, but for the first time he seemed to feel a
pride that forbade him to do so....</p>
<p>"Master Keith Wellander," the father read out again with evident
haste and in a voice which he tried to make very jolly, "When
beaten in the open field, this will be my trusty shield."</p>
<p>It was <i>the</i> package--and the trough was forgotten.</p>
<p>The boy trembled with excitement. His hands tore vainly at the
paper cover, which, in the end, had to be removed by the
father.</p>
<p>On the table, fully revealed at last, stood a real fortress of
cardboard, with a drawbridge that could be raised, and a tower in
the centre, and at the top of it a flagstaff flying the Swedish
colours.</p>
<p>It was his heart's most cherished desire, the thing that had
seemed so unattainable that he had deemed it useless to whisper it
into his mother's ear.</p>
<p>For a long while he did not move at all, but just looked and
looked, seemingly afraid to touch the new toy. Then a warm flood of
joy shot through him, and suddenly he was seized by an irresistible
impulse to kiss his father--which was a most unusual endearment
between them. As he put his hand on the table to get off the chair,
it touched the trough, and once more his mood changed. He seemed to
stiffen, and all he could do was to hold out his hand and
whisper:</p>
<p>"Thank you very much, papa!"</p>
<br>
<br>

<h2><a name="II_IV"></a>IV</h2>
<br>
<p>On Christmas Day morning everybody rose while it was still pitch
dark outside. After a hasty cup of coffee, the parents and Keith
set off for Great Church to attend <i>julotta</i>--yule matins--an
early service held only that one day of the year.</p>
<p>More snow had fallen, and now it was freezing, so that every
step they took produced a peculiar, almost metallic crunching. From
every quarter silent crowds in their holiday best streamed toward
the old church. They seemed very solemn, but Keith sensed the happy
spirit underlying their outward sedateness. It filled him with a
wild desire to romp, and it was merely the awe of his father's
presence that kept him in check.</p>
<p>The church was packed, but they found good seats. Keith had eyes
for one thing only: the Star of Bethlehem that blazed above the
screen of darkly green spruces surrounding the altar. All the rest
of it was lost on him.</p>
<p>Then the organ music burst forth, and for a moment he cowered as
under a blow. It was too much of a novelty, and the vibrations
touched his supersensitive nerves annoyingly. After a while he grew
more accustomed to it, but he did not like it, and he said so
loudly enough to bring him a stern glance from his father and
smiles from some of the people in the pew ahead. During the brief
sermon he slept peacefully.</p>
<p>As soon as they were home again, the fortress was brought out
and preparations made for a great siege. In the midst of it he left
his corner to put a question to the mother, who was dozing over a
book in her easy chair.</p>
<p>"How could papa know that I wanted it," he asked, and she knew
what he was thinking of.</p>
<p>"Don't you remember," she answered smiling slyly, "how you came
home one day last summer and talked about something you had seen in
a window on West Long Street, and papa was listening."</p>
<p>"So long ago," mused Keith, "and I didn't know he heard it."</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, he heard, and he remembered. You don't understand
papa. He doesn't want you to ask for things because he finds it
such a pleasure to figure out what you want and give it to you
unexpectedly."</p>
<p>Keith returned to his corner thinking hard, as was his wont at
times. The siege was postponed. He took out the trough and studied
it carefully. It would make a good boat. Then he put it down and
sat for a while looking at the little fortress--so like the one he
could see when he looked out of their front windows. His heart
swelled, and with a rush that nearly upset his little table, he
made for his father in the parlour, crawled up on his lap, put both
arms about his neck, and kissed him. And to his surprise he was not
repelled. But a moment later his father put him down on the floor
and said in a voice that sounded a little choked:</p>
<p>"Go back and play with your soldiers now."</p>
<p>Then came dinner, always the same on Christmas Day:
<i>sm&ouml;rgasbord</i>; roasted fresh ham with mashed potatoes and
tiny cubes of Swedish turnips fried in butter; rice and milk; cake
and wine.</p>
<p>And the day ended as it had begun, happily and peacefully. Never
had the boy felt more warmly toward his father. But at dinner the
next day, which was also a holiday so that the father was at home,
Keith happened to spill something on the table cloth.</p>
<p>"Remember your Christmas present," said the father sharply. "You
are old enough to behave properly at table, and if you won't, we
shall let you eat in your own corner and eat out of the
trough."</p>
<p>During the rest of that day Keith could not play with his
fortress. Once he took the trough to the window that happened to be
open and contemplated the possibility of dropping it into the lane.
But his courage failed him.</p>
<p>It stayed with him as part of his little stock of toys, and
gradually it came to be viewed with a certain amount of
indifference. But on the rare occasions when he was permitted to
have a playmate at home, he always managed to hide the trough under
his mother's bureau. And even the mere consciousness of its
presence there would sometimes set his cheeks burning.</p>

<br>
<p>It was summer again. The school was closed. Keith's pleas to be
allowed to play with Johan became impassioned. Consequently his
parents were pleased when Aunt Brita asked if Keith could spend a
few weeks with them in a little cottage they had hired on an island
halfway between Stockholm and the open sea.</p>
<p>To Keith this was a tremendous adventure--his first excursion
from home, and almost his first acquaintance with real country
life. In fact, the impressions of the journey itself were so many
and so novel that his mind couldn't retain anything at all. The
same thing happened over and over again during the earlier part of
his life, so that out of that epoch-making summer visit, for
instance, only a single slight incident took up a lasting abode in
his memory.</p>
<p>The cottage stood in the middle of the island, which was so
small that a fifteen-minute walk took them down to the nearest
shore. Thither they went one afternoon not long after his arrival
to bathe--his aunt, his cousin Carl who was a year younger than
himself, Keith, a couple of other children of the same age, and
Mina, an eighteen-year old girl living with Keith's uncle and aunt
in a position halfway between ward and servant. Across the fields
and along shaded wood paths they ran joyously to a sheltered bay
with a sandy beach from which the open fjord could be seen in the
distance. The children stripped helter-skelter and went into the
shallow water as nature had made them, but Mina, who was to assist
them, had for want of bathing suit put on a starched white
petticoat. The upper part of her body was bare, showing two
beautifully pointed breasts.</p>
<p>Keith looked and looked at those breasts until Mina noticed him
and actually began to blush. As if embarrassed, she picked up one
of the other children and began to swing it around in a circle. Her
movement turned Keith's attention to the petticoat, and suddenly he
could think of nothing else.</p>
<p>The children were naked. Why should Mina wear a piece of
clothing that even Keith could see was quite unfitted for such a
use. There must be something to hide. What could it be? At last he
could contain himself no longer, but blurted out:</p>
<p>"Why does Mina wear that silly skirt?"</p>
<p>"Because she is afraid of catching cold," replied his aunt from
the shore with a slight jeer in her voice and one of her shrewd
smiles.</p>
<p>"Why shouldn't we catch cold, too," was his next question.</p>
<p>There was no direct answer, but he could hear his aunt mutter
between her teeth:</p>
<p>"Drat that boy!"</p>
<p>Then she burst into open laughter, while Mina rushed ashore and
hastily began to dress behind a close screen of undergrowth.</p>
<p>After that Mina did not go in bathing with the children.</p>
<p>Many years later Keith could still visualize the whole scene as
if it had happened only a few days ago, while all his efforts to
recall the cottage where they lived, or anything else seen that
summer, were vain.</p>
<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 35%;">
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="II_VI"></a>VI</h2>
<br>
<p>In the autumn of that year Keith was sent to a "real" school,
selected after much inquiry by his parents as combining a
reasonable degree of efficiency and social standing with an equally
reasonable cost of tuition. It was private like the first one, kept
by two middle-aged spinster sisters, one of whom was tall, angular
and firm, while the other was short, fat and sentimental. It held
about two scores of pupils, most of whom were girls. These girls
ranged in years to the near-marriageable age, while none of the
boys was more than eight years old. Thus the atmosphere was
distinctly feminine, which in the eyes of Keith's mother marked an
added advantage.</p>
<p>The only thing that excited Keith about the new school was that
it took him farther from home than he had ever been allowed to
wander unattended before, into a hitherto unexplored region of the
city known as the South End. It was a poor man's neighbourhood on
the whole, but of that Keith knew nothing at the time. The school
occupied a few large and sunny rooms in the rear part of a
sprawling old stone structure built like a palace around an
enormous cobble-stoned courtyard, with a tall arched gateway
providing entrance from the street under the front part of the
house. For a while it was quite impressive and a little disturbing,
but like everything else it soon became familiar and
commonplace.</p>
<p>To get there from his own part of town, Keith had to cross the
Sluice--a lock enabling vessels to pass safely from Lake Maelaren
to the salt waters of the Bay in spite of the frequently sharp
difference of level. At either end of the lock was a drawbridge in
two sections raised from the centre to let the larger vessels
through. The place was full of interesting sights, and Keith loved
in particular to press right up against the edge of the raised
bridge as some steamer or small sailing vessel glided leisurely in
or out of the ever shifting waters of the lock.</p>
<p>At first it never occurred to him that he might walk around by
the other bridge when the one right in his way happened to be open,
and so he was late at school several times in quick succession. The
first time he was warned. The second he was placed in a corner of
the room with his face to the wall and kept there for about one
quarter of an hour. The third time the elder Miss Ahlberg applied a
ruler to the finger-tips of his left hand, which she held in a firm
grasp within one of her own.</p>
<p>The physical sensation gave the boy a terrible shock. No one had
ever really hurt him before. The spankings administered at home
once in a very great while were like thunderstorms, with a great
deal of noise and small harm done. This was something else, and
more intimidating than the pain was the manifest intention of the
teacher to inflict it. Her face was tense and her eyes flashed
fire. Worst of all, however, was the shame of it, for the
punishment was applied in front of the whole school.</p>
<p>When Keith retired to his own seat sobbing bitterly, he felt
that he could never look the other children in the face, and that
they probably would shun him as a pariah. The only thing would be
to tell his mother that he could not go back to school again. He
was still shaking with sobs, when he heard a boy on the chair
behind him whisper into his ear:</p>
<p>"Oh, that's nothing. You just wait till she pulls your hair. She
pulls it right out by the roots. I'll show you a bare spot on my
head during the next pause."</p>
<p>And so he did when the lesson came to an end and they were
permitted to play for a few minutes. Other children joined them,
and no one seemed to think less of Keith for what had happened to
him. It was a revelation to him and opened vistas of considerable
interest. But the memory of the physical and mental shock received
was more powerful, and after that he took care to reach school in
time regardless of what might be the temptations along his path or
the effort it might cost him to get there.</p>
<p>In fact, the incident became to some extent determining for his
whole career in school. He never voluntarily did anything that
might expose him to punishment, and rarely was he able to forget
himself to the extent of incurring reproof. He turned out a docile
pupil, and on the whole, docility did not come hard to him. In
spite of the vitality with which he overflowed, there was a certain
timidity attaching to him.</p>
<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 35%;">
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="II_VII"></a>VII</h2>
<br>
<p>It would be wrong to conclude that the little school of the
Misses Ahlberg was characterized by any reign of terror. As a rule,
the atmosphere was peaceful and kindly, and the teaching was rather
good. Keith was eager to learn, and learning came easy to him. In
those early days, of course, there was no studying to be done at
home, but even in later years he never knew what it was to "plug."
In fact, he could not do it. Either his interest was aroused, and
then he absorbed the matter at hand in the way he breathed, without
the least conscious effort; or his interest remained unstirred, in
which case no amount of mechanical application would help. Learning
by rote offered no escape in the latter case, for his memory
operated in the same way as the rest of his mind, sucking up what
fitted it as a blotter sucks the ink, and presenting a surface of
polished marble to any matter not germane according to its own
mysterious standards.</p>
<p>Soon he could read without any effort whatsoever--anything.
Reckoning came easy, too, but writing came hard. It seemed so much
easier to take in than to give out in any form. Grammar gave him no
difficulty, because it dealt with words, and words possessed a
magic charm that always held him. Gradually he began to dip into
history and geography--wonderful realms into which his imagination
plunged headlong. He took almost as eagerly to the old stories out
of the Bible--stories of which he had caught more than a glimpse at
home--but the Catechism was like washing in the morning: it had to
be done because higher powers so decreed.</p>
<p>Yes, he learned a good deal for a little boy of his age, but he
never knew how it happened. The school was never quite real to him.
His home was real, and his play at home. So was his daily walk to
and from school with its innumerable opportunities for observation
in the raw. There were people in the streets, and shops along the
road, and many different kinds of vessels in the harbour. There was
the guardhouse on the little square halfway to school, kept by a
small detachment of soldiers that were relieved every noon and that
never belonged to the same regiment two days in succession.
Watching them gave him many suggestions for handling his own tin
soldiers in a more business-like fashion.</p>
<p>But at school.... He was never absentminded or unattentive, for
that might have brought the quick clutch of the elder Miss
Ahlberg's bony hand into his own supersensitive crop of hair, and
most of what was going on had enough interest in itself to prevent
his mind from straying far afield. He knew the names of his fellow
pupils. He played with those of his own age, and he had likes and
dislikes, as was natural. But through it all he moved as through a
mist, seeing only the thing immediately at hand, and losing sight
of everything the moment he had passed it. The three years spent in
that school seemed to telescope into each other so that soon
afterwards he found himself unable to tell if a thing had happened
during the first or last of those years. Nor did the things he
remembered have any connection with the school as a rule, and out
of all the boys and girls he met there not one remained distinct in
his memory as did the figure of Harald from the first school. When
he left the school to go home for the day, he was done with it, and
nothing followed him but what was stored in his head. And that,
too, seemed forgotten at the time, to be re-discovered later with a
sense of pleasant surprise.</p>
<p>And all that time things were happening to him at home and
elsewhere that, as far as importance went, stood in curious
contrast to his quickly forgotten experiences at school--things
that burnt themselves into his mind as a part of its permanent
contents....</p>
<br>

<h2><a name="II_VIII"></a>VIII</h2>
<br>
<p>There was not a private bathroom to be found in Stockholm in
those days. One washed hands and face and neck whenever compelled
to, and some people, like Keith's father, splashed the upper part
of their bodies with water every morning regardless of weather and
temperature. Once a week every self-respecting person went to a
public bath for a thorough steaming and scrubbing.</p>
<p>Keith's mother did like the rest, and generally she took the boy
along as he was admitted without extra charge. Then mother and son
would get into a tremendous tub full of hot water--so large and so
full that Keith had to sit up in order to keep his head above
water. He always enjoyed it very much, and especially he enjoyed
feeling his mother's soft body close to his own.</p>
<p>On an occasion of this kind he had already finished his bath and
was sitting on a wooden bench beside the tub wrapped in a big
sheet. The old woman attendant stood ready with a similar sheet for
his mother, who was just stepping out of the tub facing the
boy.</p>
<p>She was still young, and her skin, always beautiful, was aglow
with the heat of the bath and the friction of the scrubbing.</p>
<p>Keith stared open-eyed at her, unconscious of any particular
interest, and yet filled with a vague, slightly disturbing sense of
pleasure.</p>
<p>Then his mother caught his glance. Their eyes met. A slight
flush spread over her face.</p>
<p>Grabbing the sheet from the old woman, she flung it about
herself. As she did so, he heard her say to the attendant:</p>
<p>"That young gentleman will have to bathe with his father
hereafter, I guess."</p>
<p>At first he was conscious of a rebuke, and the cause of it left
him quite at sea. He would probably have puzzled over it a great
deal more than he did, had not his mind become preoccupied with the
idea that he would be allowed to accompany his father to the men's
part of the establishment. It was an idea that filled him with a
sort of shrinking pride.</p>
<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 35%;">
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="II_IX"></a>IX</h2>
<br>
<p>Among the less intimate friends of his mother was a young widow
with a little girl about a year younger than Keith. For some reason
unknown to the boy, those two came to see his mother several times
that Spring. It was the first time in his life Keith met a girl on
familiar terms.</p>
<p>Clara was slender and elfish, with a wealth of yellow tresses
falling down her back. She was tender and gay, too, and Keith liked
to hear her laugh. When they played, she was always ready to fall
in with any whim of Keith's.</p>
<p>One afternoon, when the days were growing longer, Clara's mother
asked permission to leave her with the Wellanders while she
attended to some business in the neighbourhood. Keith's mother was
occupied in the kitchen in some manner making her wish to have the
door to the living-room closed. Thus the two children were left to
play by themselves.</p>
<p>He never could remember how it began, and he could not tell what
put the idea in his head....</p>
<p>It was a new game, and she played it as readily as any other he
might have proposed. They had crawled so far into his own corner by
the window that they were almost hidden behind mamma's bureau.</p>
<p>At first they whispered to each other, eagerly as children do,
but only with the eagerness they might have shown if playing
hide-and-seek. Then he raised her little dress, and she didn't seem
to mind. He also undid his own dress, and they studied each other's
bodies, noting the differences.</p>
<p>The end of it was that they laid down together on the floor. He
put his mouth to hers and hugged her just as tightly as he could.
When they had been lying in way for a while, he whispered to
her:</p>
<p>"Isn't it nice?"</p>
<p>And she dutifully whispered back: "It is!"</p>
<p>A few minutes later they were playing with his tin soldiers, and
soon after Clara's mother returned to take her away.</p>
<p>During their entire play both doors had remained closed. Keith
was quite sure of that. He had looked before he started the new
game, although he was not aware of trespassing on prohibited
territory.</p>
<p>Afterwards he felt rather uneasy. There was a distinct sense of
risk attaching to that game, and he wondered whether Clara might
tell her mother. At the same time the thought of what he had done
filled him with inexplicable satisfaction, as if, in some way, he
had put something over on the grown-ups.</p>
<p>As for his own mother--she seemed to be watching him with
unusual concern during the next few days, and he could not escape a
suspicion that she knew. Closed doors did not seem to prevent
grown-up people from knowing what children did.</p>
<p>At the same time he wondered why he and Clara should not be
playing as they had done. There was really nothing to it. And the
comparisons they had made took no hold of his imagination. The
differences revealed he accepted as he accepted anything that had
no direct bearing on his own happiness.</p>
<p>As far as he could recall afterwards, he never saw Clara again.
Nor did he seem to miss her.</p>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<h2><a name="II_X"></a>X</h2>
<br>
<p>Summer again.</p>
<p>The incident with Clara was forgotten. Yet Keith had a sense of
being watched a little more closely than usual. He was rarely
permitted to go out alone after his return from school. And he was
scolded if he ever was late in coming home.</p>
<p>There was mystery in the air. The parents talked together a good
deal in a way that made Keith understand they were talking about
him and did not want to be overheard.</p>
<p>As soon as school closed the secret became revealed. He would be
sent into the real country for the summer to board with perfect
strangers.</p>
<p>"Any children," was Keith's first question. Yes, a couple of
sons in the house, and probably one or two more boys from the city,
boarders like Keith.</p>
<p>It seemed the thing had been planning for a long time. The
mother said something about the necessity for Keith of going where
everything was clean and wholesome--the air, the food, the people.
The boy knew that she had been worrying about him for some reason
he could not guess.</p>
<p>An advertisement in a newspaper had led his mother on the track
of what she wanted. She read it to him--"a religious family with
children of their own would take a few well-behaved boys of good
family for the summer months and give them a real home and as good
as parental care."</p>
<p>It turned out to be the sexton of a country parish on the
northern shore of Lake Maelaren who had devised this means of eking
out his probably limited professional income. The ensuing
correspondence had proved quite satisfactory. The mother was
evidently pleased. It was almost as good as staying with the pastor
himself, she said.</p>
<p>Keith knew what a pastor was. He had several times heard one
preach from a funny hanging box in Great Church, and he thought of
him as a man who was always dressed in black and who was even more
serious than the father. But it did not bother him, partly because
he realized that, after all, a sexton was not the same as a pastor,
and partly because his mind was full of something else. It was not
the country, although his previous experience of it, when he was
staying with his aunt, had given him a rather favourable
impression. No, what occupied him to the exclusion of everything
else was the thought that he would be able to play with other
children all day long, and that there would be no one to pull him
away just as a game was becoming really interesting.</p>
<p>Exciting days of preparation followed. And finally the day of
departure dawned.</p>
<p>The greater part of the journey was to be made by boat to the
little town of Enk&ouml;ping, where Mr. Swensson, the sexton, would
be waiting with a team. The mother could not go along, and so Keith
was placed in the hands of some people going the same way, who
promised to look after him and see that he did not fall into wrong
hands when the steamer landed.</p>
<p>Keith had to stand in the stern of the boat and wave his
handkerchief as long as his mother remained visible. Then he was
free, at last, to surrender himself to the novelty of his
situation. And as always upon such occasions, when new impressions
came crowding in upon him, the record became too blurred for clear
remembrance. This was true not only of the trip on the steamer, the
arrival at Enk&ouml;ping with its little old-fashioned red houses,
the meeting with Mr. Swanson, the drive of thirty miles or more
inland, the arrival at the sexton's house not far from a white
spired church, and the introduction to a seemingly endless number
of new faces, but of the whole long summer. A couple of months
sufficed to wipe out of his memory everything but a few
comparatively trivial incidents and impressions.</p>
<p>Only one name escaped the general oblivion--that of the sexton
himself. Only one view left a lasting image behind--that of a
tremendously large boulder, a memento of the glacial period, that
rose like a crude monument right in the centre of a tilled field
almost, but not quite out of sight of the house. Only one face
would come back in recognizable shape when he tried to recall that
rather momentous summer--that of a boy a few years older than
himself, who was the leader of all the games played around the big
rock in the open field.</p>
<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 35%;">
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="II_XI"></a>XI</h2>
<br>
<p>Quite a gang of boys gathered daily about the big rock,
generally on the farther side of it where they could not be seen
from the house. Beyond the rock in that direction was nothing but
an open field, and then the woods, rarely disturbed by a visitor.
Thus they were really more safe than indoors as no one could
approach them without being detected while still far away.</p>
<p>The two sons of the sexton were there, and a couple of boys from
the city besides Keith, and three or four sons of neighbouring
farmers. They ranged in ages from eight to eleven or twelve. Keith
was the baby, but this was never held up against him. He was
commonly treated as an equal, which raised his self-confidence
tremendously, but it had also a somewhat embarrassing effect when
the others seemed to take for granted that he knew as much as they
concerning the matters that most occupied their minds--to judge by
their talk at least.</p>
<p>The oldest of the lot, and their undisputed leader, was a
peasant boy of remarkable ugliness, squint-eyed and snub-nosed,
with tufts of yellow hair always falling over his face and several
teeth missing. His clothes were in rags and he never wore shoes. He
boasted of never washing unless "the old one" stood over him with a
stick, and his language was worse than both his manners and his
looks. An unbroken stream of profanity and obscenity poured from
his rarely silent mouth, and he heaped withering scorn on any
attempt at decent speech.</p>
<p>Keith had now and then picked up questionable words while
playing in the lane where he lived. Johan sported some of them in
moments of furious rebellion against his mother's "holiness," as he
called it. Once or twice Keith had repeated such words at home and
suffered for it. Soon he learned to know the type at first hearing,
and he disliked this part of the vocabulary even when he could use
it without danger to himself. He developed a greater daintiness in
words than in anything else, but this summer formed an exception.
The force of suggestion brought to bear on him was too
overwhelming, and he strove boldly to vie with the rest in foulness
of tongue and thought. As soon as he was back in the city, this
habit dropped off him as the soap lather is washed off a bather
when he dives into the clear waters of a lake. But the game he had
learned to play back of the big rock could not be unlearned in the
same way.</p>
<p>This game was in itself a revelation to Keith. He was not
shocked or startled, because he had no standards in the matter, but
at first he experienced a distinct revulsion. This wore off
quickly, however, and soon he accepted what he saw as a natural
thing. The boy whose face stuck in Keith's mind with such strange
persistency set the pace, and everybody seemed to hold him a hero
on that account. Even the other city boys surrendered after a brief
resistance and tried humbly to emulate the acknowledged leader.</p>
<p>Everything took place openly in the most brazen fashion, as if
they had been playing leap-frog or hide-and-seek. Every one boasted
of his own achievements and tried to outdo the rest in unashamed
performance. Yet it was not so much a question of companionship in
indulgence as of sportsmanlike competition. Pleasure had little to
do with it. What they did, and still more what they pretended to
have done, was an assertion and a proof of manliness, and so was
the language they used among themselves. If they hid from the older
people, that was not because they regarded themselves as engaged in
any sinful pursuits, but because the grown-ups to them appeared
jealous of all childish pleasures, and particularly jealous of the
pleasures most treasured by themselves.</p>
<p>Outwardly Keith played the part of an interested but passive
observer. When taunted for his timidity, or as being a mere infant,
he parried by using a number of nasty words, some of which he did
not know the meaning of. When by himself, he soon found that he
could play the game as well as the rest, and it increased his sense
of self-importance very much, but of this he said nothing to any
one. Something within his own nature protested against the
flaunting of such an act, though the act itself carried no offence
to his childish mind. The inner protest was not strong enough to
break into words or to make the companionship of the other boys
seem repulsive to him. Nor was it concerned with anything Keith did
by himself.</p>
<p>The summer went very fast. Keith was sorry when told that it was
time for him to go home. He would come back, of course, but his
regrets were only momentary. No sooner was he started than the idea
of seeing his mother, Granny, and his tin soldiers again, put
everything else out of his mind.</p>
<p>His mother was overjoyed to see him and revelled in his healthy
looks. She made him tell her at great length, over and over again,
about everything he had seen and done, about the place and the
people, about the food and the games he had played. Keith talked
and talked, eagerly and freely, but of the game played behind the
big rock he never said a word.</p>
<p>He was then not quite seven years old.</p>
<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 35%;">
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="II_XII"></a>XII</h2>
<br>
<p>That autumn and winter he was permitted to play a good deal with
Johan, and always in Johan's home. His mother had a bad spell of
depression, and while it made her fret and worry more than ever
about Keith, as well as about everything else, she was either too
weak to resist his pleas, or she felt his absence as a relief.</p>
<p>To his intense surprise, Keith found that Johan already knew all
about the new game, and that he was quite willing to play it. And
for a couple of years it became an important part of what they had
in common. Chances were not lacking, for Johan's mother was too
wrapt up in her postils and religious speculations to watch them
closely, and there was always the outhouse to which they could
retire for privacy.</p>
<p>Their relationship was a peculiar one. Although the younger by a
few months and the smaller by several inches, Keith was the leader
and the aggressor. Johan remained passive--too passive, Keith often
thought.</p>
<p>There was nothing of love in Keith's feelings toward Johan,
nothing emotional. The tenderness that was such a marked feature of
his character did not come into play at all. In fact, he rather
looked down on Johan, who frequently annoyed him by his dullness
and his lack of personal neatness. The truth of it was that he
played with Johan merely because he was the only other boy in
sight, and in so far as that particular game was concerned, Johan
was simply an accessory to it in same way as his tin soldiers and
his toy fort.</p>
<p>In playing it, Keith had always a sense of seeking something
else, but he had not the slightest idea of what this something
might be. It must have some relation to girls, he felt vaguely, but
beyond that vague feeling he could not get. Clara remained
forgotten.</p>
<p>Gradually Johan became more and more indifferent and reluctant
as far as that game was concerned. Dull as he was, he seemed to
have some sort of scruples that Keith couldn't understand. More and
more Keith was thrown back on himself. Once more a new set of
interests began to take the lion's share of his attention, although
the game learned behind the big rock would reassert its puzzling
fascination from time to time.</p>
<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 35%;">
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="II_XIII"></a>XIII</h2>
<br>
<p>His eagerness to read and his lack of reading matter had for
some time presented a growing problem. The books of his father--and
there were quite a number of them--were taboo for a double reason:
first, because they were not held safe for him to read, and,
secondly, because his father regarded them as his particularly
private property that must not be touched by any one else.</p>
<p>So he fell back on the old Bible and chance pickings. The
stirring and bloodcurdling stories in the Books of the Maccabees
were his favourites. He read them over and over, and he tried to
dramatize that unbroken record of battles with the help of his tin
soldiers. But the reason he could return to those stories so often
was that he began studying them while reading was still a partly
mastered art, and half the time he was more interested in the game
of reading, so to speak, than in what he read.</p>
<p>A year in the new school had made a great change. He read
anything with ease, and while he read rather slowly without ever
skipping, his mind took in what he read quickly and thoroughly so
that going back over a thing once perused became less and less
attractive. He wanted new material for his mind, and he wanted it
in steadily increasing quantities.</p>
<p>One day he made a great discovery. Books could be borrowed from
other people. One of his schoolmates came to school with a
wonderful illustrated copy of "Don Quixote" arranged for children.
Keith went into ecstasies over it. The mail-clad figure of the
Knight of the Rueful Countenance on the front cover was to him the
beckoning guardian of a world of wonders, the very existence of
which he had never before suspected. Tears came into his eyes at
last as he stared hopelessly at the object of his newly born
desire. As a rule he blurted out any wish he might have, but the
thing was clearly too precious to ask as a gift or acquire by
bartering, and he had never heard of any other way of getting
it.</p>
<p>"Mercy," cried the other boy after having watched him for a
while. "You can take it home and read it, if you only promise to
bring it back."</p>
<p>For a moment Keith was too overcome to speak. Then he became
hysterical with joy. The rest of the school day passed in a trance.
He ran a good part of the way home. Arrived there, he almost forgot
to give his mother and Granny the inevitable kiss of greeting. And
he might even have refused to be bothered by such a thing but for
his fear of being put under some discipline that might prevent him
from plunging straightway into the unexplored country of
make-believe.</p>
<p>On seeing the book, his mother hesitated for a moment, but soon
she was delighted with the results it produced. Keith had no
thought of asking leave to see Johan that day. He was lost to the
world around him. Not a sound was heard from him. There was no
nervous running about in futile search for "something to do." The
home was as quiet as if he had been away, and yet there he was,
safely ensconced in his own corner, where his mother could watch
him all the time.</p>
<p>Everybody was happy until the father returned home and heard of
what had happened. Having looked the book over for a moment, while
the boy watched him with a shrinking heart, he said at last:</p>
<p>"You must return it tomorrow, and I don't want you to borrow any
more books. You may spoil it in some way, and then you will have to
pay for it, and where are you to get the money?"</p>
<p>Keith tried hard not to cry, but the blow was too overwhelming.
He was driven out of his new paradise after a tantalizing glimpse
at it. And he could not understand why. So his tears must needs
flow freely and his throat contracted convulsively with half-choked
sobs, and the final result of it was that he was ordered to bed at
once. That ended his last chance of abstracting a few more thrills
from the borrowed treasure.</p>
<p>Of course, the book was returned the next day. Keith had not yet
arrived at the point where the evasion of a parental decree seemed
conceivable. And to the sorrow of missing the promised enjoyment
was added the humiliation of confessing what had happened at home.
To lie about it was another thing that never occurred to him, and
to act without explanation was quite foreign to his nature.</p>
<p>A few sad days followed. Then his life resumed its customary
tone, and it was as if the lank, but to him far from ludicrous,
shape of Don Quixote had never crossed his horizon. And soon after
Christmas recurred once more.</p>
<p>Among the many packages falling to his share, there were two of
a shape that suggested the possibility of more tin soldiers. But
when he held them in his hand, they failed to yield to pressure as
would a cardboard box. Curiosity turned into genuine suspense. And
when at last two books lay in front of him as his own, with the
implied permission that he could read them to his heart's content
whenever he chose, a pang of something like real love for his
father shot through his heart.</p>
<p>Those two little volumes became at once his most priceless
possession and the foundation of his first library. To others they
might appear quite commonplace books, without much value from any
point of view. To him they were passports to a realm of action and
freedom and colour, where he could roam at will in search of
everything he missed in real life. One was bound in white with the
picture of an African lion hunt on the front cover. The other one
had a plain brown binding. Both had coloured illustrations and
contained stories of hunting and travelling adventures in all sorts
of out-of-the-way places. There were tales of lion hunting with
Arabs and tiger hunting in the jungles of India, of whaling in the
Arctic and hair-breadth escapes from giant snakes in South America,
of cruises in southern seas and caravaning across the high plateaus
of Central Asia.</p>
<p>One story in particular stuck in his mind, and more particularly
one little detail out of that story. It was one of comparative
repose and few sensational incidents relating the perfectly
peaceful, but nevertheless strange and interesting experiences of a
European traveller through some desert region back of the Caspian
Sea. Arriving at a nomad camp far away from all civilization, this
traveller was met with touching hospitality. During a formal visit
to the chieftain of the tribe, he was offered tea. With the tea was
handed him a bowl containing a single lump of sugar. In European
fashion he picked up this and dropped it into his cup. Not a word
was said, but something told him that he had committed some
dreadful mistake. By and by, as he watched the others, he
understood. Sugar was so rare that to use it in ordinary fashion
was out of question, and so the solitary lump served was meant to
be licked in turn by each, and he, as the guest of honour, had been
given the first chance. To Keith's mind that story seemed as
clearly realized as if he had played a part in it himself. And what
occupied him more than anything else was the pitiful existence of
those poor nomads to whom even such a common thing as sugar was an
almost unattainable luxury. It was his first lesson in human
sympathy, and it was typical of his own existence and bent that it
should have come out of a book.</p>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="II_XIV"></a>XIV</h2>
<br>
<p>From that day one of his main objects in life was to acquire
books. He had little pride as a rule, in spite of all his
sensitiveness, and when books were concerned he had none at all.
Having discovered that a friend of the family, who until then had
been regarded with supreme indifference, held some sort of clerical
position in a publishing house, his devotion to Uncle Lander
suddenly became effusive and he begged so shamelessly and so
successfully that at last his father had to intercede. Out of a
half-hour sermon on things that must not be done, Keith grasped
only that, as usual, he could not do what he wanted. Money was
still a mystery to him, and he never suspected that Uncle Lander
would have to pay his employers for every book taken out of the
stock.</p>
<p>The sole check to his passion sprang logically from the very
fervor of that passion: a book being such a precious object to
himself, he could not dream of taking it away from somebody else.
As in a flash the true spirit of his father's objection to borrowed
books was revealed to him. That objection became his own and stuck
to him through life: if he liked a borrowed book, the inescapable
duty of returning it was too painful to be faced, and if he didn't
like it, there was no reason for borrowing it. Books became sacred
things to him, to be cherished and protected as nothing else. The
loss of one was a catastrophe.</p>
<p>Soon he had a small library of his own, kept on a shelf in the
huge wardrobe that stood in the vestibule leading to the parlour.
Made up at first of odds and ends bearing no real relation to his
desire for reading matter, it gradually acquired a certain
homogeneity reflecting the boy's state of mind. Books of travel and
adventure continued to prevail for a long while. Equally favoured
were stories dealing with Norse Mythology and the heroic legends of
his race. The grim record of the Niebelungs was familiar to him at
the age of eight, and the first heroes of his worship were young
Siegfried of divine aspect and Dietrich of Bern, who seemed to the
boy the final embodiment of worldly wisdom. To these should be
added Garibaldi, of whose South American campaigns, so touchingly
shared by the faithful Anita, he read graphic accounts in an odd
volume of an illustrated weekly. The word liberty first came to him
from the lips of the picturesque Italian, while Anita and the women
of the old Germanic sagas struck him by their contrast to his
mother.</p>
<p>In the main, all his reading made for escape and compensation.
He read to get away from his own surroundings, and he revelled in
characters of fiction and legend and history that possessed
qualities lacking in himself. By nature he was a queer mixture of
rashness and timidity, but through his mother's anxiety on his
behalf the latter quality was constantly being nursed at the
expense of all tendency to action. And so, in order to keep the
balance, he revelled in the imaginary or real deeds of men whose
very life-breath was danger. The more the books gave him of what he
craved, the less he thought of looking for it in life.</p>
<p>Consequently his new passion seemed a godsend to his mother, who
encouraged him in every possible way. It brought a solution of many
difficulties and worries by keeping him at home and quiet. The only
resistance came, as usual, from the father, who repeatedly
counselled moderation and often made the boy drop his book and turn
to something else--which seemed to Keith the worst of all the
tyrannies to which he found himself exposed. But most of the time
the father was powerless because of his absence from home, and soon
Keith learned that his reading formed the only exception to his
mother's general refusal to permit any circumvention of his
father's explicit command.</p>
<p>It also became plain to Keith that the mother favoured his love
for the books not only as a means of relief to herself. Evidently
she held it admirable in itself and a promise bearing in some
mysterious manner on his future. His mother's approval flattered
him, but otherwise her attitude was a riddle which he did not care
to solve as long as it brought him permission to explore at will
this newly discovered world of perfectly safe enjoyment. In the
end, however, that strange reverence shown by his mother combined
with his own increasing ability to live the cherished life of his
dreams at second hand into an influence that more or less warped
his entire outlook on life. It robbed to some extent of his sense
of proportion.</p>
<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 35%;">
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="II_XV"></a>XV</h2>
<br>
<p>His father noticed his timidity and seemed to view it with a
sense of humiliation. Once, in the presence of company, he
threatened to put him into skirts "like any other girl." Keith had
played too little with other children to have acquired the usual
male consciousness of superiority, but his father's words cut him
to the quick nevertheless, because he knew them to be meant for an
insult. He resolved then and there to show his mettle in some
striking way, and promptly be began to dream of such ways, but
chance being utterly lacking for even a normal display of boyish
daring, it merely served to plunge him more deeply into the sham
life of his books.</p>
<p>Yet he was not without courage, and it was not physical pain, or
the fear of it, that brought the tears so quickly into flowing.
Once, when returning home with an uncovered bowl full of molasses
from the grocery, he stumbled at the foot of the stairs and fell so
his forehead struck the edge of the lowest step and his scalp was
cut open to the width of nearly an inch. The blood blinded him so
that he could barely make his way upstairs. When he reached the
kitchen at last, his mother was scared almost out of her wits, and
her fright was augmented by the manner in which he sobbed as if his
heart were breaking. When at last the flow of blood was partly
stenched and his crying still continued, his mother tried to tell
him that there was no cause to be scared.</p>
<p>"I am not scared," he sputtered to her surprise. "I didn't know
I was hurt, but ... but ... I spilled all the molasses."</p>
<p>That night his father gave him a shining new silver coin without
telling him why, and the boy couldn't guess it at the time, though
later he learned the reason from his mother.</p>
<p>A favourite method employed by the father to test and to develop
his courage was to send him alone after dark on some errand into
the cellar or up into the attic, and the boy went without protest,
no matter how much he might dread the task at heart. Even the
servant girls felt reluctant about visiting the cellar at night,
and the occasional discovery of a drunken man asleep in front of
the cellar door made the danger far from imaginary.</p>
<p>Going down to the cellar, Keith was permitted to bring a candle
along, but the danger of fire made this out of the question when
the attic was his goal. One night on his way up there, he
discovered a white, fluttering shape by the square opening in the
outer wall. He stopped on the spot, and his heart almost stopped,
too--but only for a moment. Driven by some necessity he could not
explain to himself, he picked himself together and pushed on, only
to find that the intimidating spectre consisted of some white
clothing hung for drying on the iron rod of the shutter and kept
moving by a high wind. It was a lesson that went right home and
stuck.</p>
<p>During that one moment of hesitation, the idea of a ghost tried
to take form in his more or less paralysed consciousness. He had
read of ghosts, and overheard stories told by the servant girls in
apparent good faith, and that whitish, almost luminous thing in
front of him, stirring restlessly with a faint hissing sound,
looked and acted the part of a ghost to perfection. But the idea
was rejected before it had taken clear shape and without any
reasoning, instinctively, automatically. His father always became
scornful at the mere mention of ghosts, and that settled it.</p>
<p>When it was all over, and he was safe within the kitchen door
once more, he told no one what had happened. He thought that, in
spite of his initial scare, he had acted decidedly well, and he was
eager for approval, but he was kept from telling by an uneasy
feeling that his father would laugh at him if he did.</p>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<p>The boy's timidity took quite different forms. One day the whole
family was astir. His parents had in some way obtained tickets to
that evening's performance at the Royal Opera. As the custom of the
place was to permit the holders of two adjoining seats to bring in
a child with them, it was decided after much discussion that Keith
might go along. His mother tried to explain the nature and purpose
of a theatrical performance, but what she said made no impression
on the boy, who was more excited by the thought of accompanying his
parents than by what he might hear or see.</p>
<p>Their seats were in a box in the third tier. It was like being
suspended halfway between the top and the bottom of a gigantic
well. The depth of that well affected the boy unpleasantly, while
the strong light and the hum of talk confused him. He clung closely
to his mother with averted face. Suddenly the light went out, and
he heard his mother whisper:</p>
<p>"Look now!"</p>
<p>Glancing up, he found that a new room full of people had
appeared where before was nothing but a flat wall.</p>
<p>"What became of the wall, mamma," he asked aloud. She hushed him
with a smile, and he heard some one in another box titter.</p>
<p>"Now keep very quiet and try to follow what happens on the
stage," his mother admonished in another whisper.</p>
<p>They were giving Auber's "Crown Diamonds." The rich dresses
appealed somewhat to him, but not strongly. The music made no
impression on him whatsoever. The general effect on his mind was
one of bewilderment, that soon lapsed into bored indifference. Then
he discovered that most of the men on the stage were armed, and
that some of them acted as if they might put their weapons into use
at any moment. And he, the ardent participant in all the bloody
deeds of Siegfried and Dietrich and Kriemhild, he, the passionate
hunter of big game on five continents, became so nervous that
nothing but fear of his father kept him from burying his head in
his mother's lap in order not to see any more. When, at last, a
shot rang out on the stage, even that fear could no longer restrain
him, and there was nothing for his mother to do but to escort him
out of the box into the corridor. There, under the care of a
friendly doorkeeper who treated him to candy out of a paper bag, he
stayed in perfect contentment until his parents were ready to go
home.</p>
<p>"Oh, we must go again, Carl," he heard his mother cry in a tone
of high exultation.</p>
<p>"All right, you go," said the father with a yawn, Keith and I
don't care--do we, Keith?"</p>
<p>"No," Keith replied mechanically, but even as he spoke he became
conscious of a desire to share his mother's enthusiasm rather than
his father's indifference. If they would only promise not to shoot!

<br>
<p>Three years he remained in the school of the Misses Ahlberg.
Three times fall and winter and spring were followed by that
painfully delicious period of almost unbroken daylight, when the
very books seemed to lose some of their magic, when even the air of
the old lane became fraught with some mystic urge, and when life
within stone walls turned into an unbearable burden.</p>
<p>He rose by degrees from mere spelling to the study of a foreign
language, German. He learned his Catechism by heart--or rather by
rote, for the time-worn phrases dropped from his lips at demand
very much as water runs down a mill sluice, without leaving any
trace. In fact, little of what he learned appeared to touch his
real life at all. Nor could he be made to take it very seriously,
although, on the whole, he was counted a good pupil.</p>
<p>He used schoolbooks, of course, but he was rarely caught reading
one of them. His mind seemed to master the offered knowledge by
some mysterious process of absorption of which he himself was never
aware. Study in the sense of close and painful application was
quite foreign to him. Yet he seemed capable of mastering anything
that aroused his interest--or that stirred his vanity, for he loved
to shine. Unfortunately most of his schoolmates were dull plodders
who had not yet reached a stage where plodding counted, and so his
triumphs came easy and there was nothing to spur him into serious
effort.</p>
<p>At the end of the third year he had practically exhausted the
possibilities of the little school in the South End, and it was
understood that he would not return in the fall, when he would be
nine years old. But nothing had been decided about what he was to
do instead.</p>
<p>He had not been unhappy with the Misses Ahlberg and his
leave-taking lacked none of the expected emotional colouring. Yet
he left without a pang, without regrets. It was as if he had passed
through that school in his sleep, waking up only when he reached
home and his books. He had made no friends and formed no ties at
school, and outside of it he had never associated with any of his
schoolmates. Not one of them left a mark on his memory as Harald
had done. In a place full of girls, his little heart never was
betrayed into a single quickened beat of anticipation. Nor did he
make any new connections outside of the school during those years.
One might almost say that he had ceased to realize the existence of
things or persons except in so far as they administered to some
immediate need within himself.</p>
<p>Summer came early that year, and with it came a marked change.
His restlessness grew almost morbid, so that his mother found it
nearly impossible to keep him indoors. He was every minute pleading
for leave to play with Johan, and on several occasions when
permission had been granted, he and Johan left the quiet lane to
play with strange boys on the Quay. It drove his mother almost to
despair, and she tried one thing after another to keep him at
home.</p>
<p>She was doing some embroidery at that particular time and the
work seemed to interest the boy a great deal. Sometimes, when he
had given up all hope of getting out, he could stand for many
minutes at a time watching the needle with its tail of brightly
coloured yarn pass in and out through the wide meshes of the
fabric. Finally his mother suggested that he try his hand at it,
and he grabbed eagerly at that chance of diversion. For about three
days he was as devoted to his needle as any girl. By that time he
had filled a small square with a sort of design of his own, and
when his father returned home in the evening of the third day,
Keith displayed his achievement with considerable pride.</p>
<p>"Fine," remarked the father dryly. "Now we know what to do with
him if Uncle Granstedt does not think good him enough for a
carpenter. We'll apprentice him to a tailor. He'll make a good one,
I am sure, as it takes nine tailors to make a man, he need not have
as much courage as a woman even."</p>
<p>That disposed of the embroidery once for all, but it seemed also
to bring matters to a head. As soon as the father was done with his
meal, the mother made him accompany her into the parlour, and there
they stayed an endless time. When they returned to the living-room,
Keith could see that his mother had been crying, but she was
smiling brightly at that moment, and her voice had a ring of
triumph when she said:</p>
<p>"Papa has something to tell you, Keith."</p>
<p>"Yes," the father drawled. "Your mother, as usual, has persuaded
me to do what I doubt is right. Because she has pleaded for you,
I'll let you enter the public school in the fall. That will cost
money, and I am not sure it is good for a poor man's son like you,
but we'll see. It means that you will have to do some studying at
last, for if you don't--well, then you'll have to learn a
trade."</p>
<p>As always on such occasions, Keith took his cue from the mother,
and her mien told him that he ought to be pleased. It was a new
departure anyhow, and it implied evidently an advance that would
administer to his rather undernourished sense of self-importance.
For anything doing so he had a passionate craving, and so he was
ready to rejoice.</p>
<p>The new school was still far off, however, and in the meantime
there was close at hand a problem that piqued him annoyingly. Had
his father really meant to make a carpenter or a tailor of him if
his mother had not interceded, or was the talk about it merely an
expression of the father's peculiar unwillingness to admit any sort
of tender feeling toward the son?</p>
<p>That was not the way Keith put it, in so far as he attempted any
formulation at all, but it was in substance what his momentary
speculations amounted to, and the solution of the problem lay quite
beyond him. He never could make out just what his father meant or
thought or felt in regard to himself.</p>

<br>
<p>Then several developments followed each other in quick
succession. First of all his father bought him a season ticket at
the public baths in the North River and made him join a class of
small boys for instruction in the manly art of swimming. The world
was opening up, Keith felt, and his father was lured to the verge
of openly expressed satisfaction at finding that the boy's timidity
did not extend to cold water.</p>
<p>No sooner, however, had he mastered the mechanics of the thing
sufficiently to graduate from the board-walk onto a cork pillow in
the water, than he had to quit because the whole family was "going
into the country" for the summer. To Keith this meant a chance of
playing with other children without having to ask permission every
time and rarely getting it. To his mother it meant a distinct
social advance, as no family staying in town all summer could be
held really respectable.</p>
<p>The "country" was located on one of the numerous islands forming
the outskirts of the city and could be reached by the father after
he finished work by a fifteen-minute ride on one of the innumerable
little steamboats running back and forth like so many busy shuttles
across every sheet of water in the vicinity of Stockholm. Even then
it was a suburb, but the houses were called villas, and there were
plenty of trees between the buildings, and the roads meandering
whimsically among miniature lawns and gardens had no pavements, and
the lake came right up to the door.</p>
<p>There the father had rented a single room from some
acquaintances who made their home on the island all the year round.
The man was a German who had recently returned to Sweden after
serving as a noncommissioned officer in the Franco-Prussian war--a
stocky Bavarian with a tremendous black beard, a fondness for
top-boots and long-stemmed pipes, and a startling tendency to shout
every communication in the form of a command. He was a good-natured
soul nevertheless, in spite of his appearance, his occasional
bursts of temper, and his exaggerated regard for discipline, and he
was full of stories about real fighting that differed puzzlingly
from what Keith had read about such matters. Uncle Laube had a pet
phrase that stuck in the boy's mind and exercised a corroding
influence on some of his most cherished sentiments:</p>
<p>"A man must be able to fight, but it is black hell when he has
to."</p>
<p>There were three children in the family--a boy two or three
years older than Keith, a girl of his own age and a baby sister.
The boy was named Adolph and the elder girl Marie. All three of
them, but especially the boy, were being brought up in strict
Teutonic fashion, which made a sort of super-religion out of
obedience. At the mere sound of his father's voice, Adolph trembled
and stiffened up like a recruit under training. Once the two boys
and Marie strayed beyond bounds to a place where some timber rafts
were tied up along the shore. Adolph led the way onto the rafts and
the two others followed. It was great fun jumping from log to log
where two rafts met, until Marie suddenly slipped into the water
and began to sink like a stone. Quick as a flash Adolph dropped on
his knees on a log that was partly under water, grabbed the girl by
her hair and pulled her out. On their return home, Adolph was
licked until he could not stand on his feet for leading the smaller
children into mischief. Then he got a crown for the pluck shown in
saving his sister's life.</p>
<p>This even balancing of justice made a deep impression on Keith.
He thought and thought of it, and his reason, which already was
very active, appreciated the logic of such a dispensation, but his
heart rebelled strangely and turned for a while to his own father
as a paragon of mildness, while the black-bearded Uncle Laube
became an object of repulsion bordering on hatred. Fortunately the
disciplinarian was away most of the day and Keith was running wild
around the island. This was not possible without some protests from
his mother, who regarded all water outside of a tub with deep
distrust. He nevertheless maintained an unusual degree of
independence until one day, while playing in one of the rowboats
lying outside a small pier near their house, he, too, fell in and
was pulled out by Adolph.</p>
<p>The children were alone at the time. Keith had no consciousness
of having been in danger, but he was in a funk because of his wet
clothing. Instead of going home at once, he ran to an open spot at
the other end of the island and played in the sun to get dry. After
a while his mother appeared, disturbed by his long absence. There
was nothing to do but to respond to her call, although he did so
most reluctantly, his clothing still being damp. His slow movements
aroused her suspicion, and in another moment the awful truth was
out.</p>
<p>"You might have drowned," his mother cried, too frightened to
scold. "Or you might have caught cold and died of that. Perhaps ...
you had better come home at once."</p>
<p>"No," protested Keith. "Adolph was there, and it hasn't been
cold at all."</p>
<p>"But think, Keith," his mother remonstrated, her eyes dim with
tears, "you wouldn't care to die and leave me?"</p>
<p>"I don't want to leave you," the boy said, "and I was not going
to."</p>
<p>She took his head between her two hands and looked long into his
eyes before she asked at last:</p>
<p>"Are you not scared of death?"</p>
<p>"I don't know," he stammered, wincing slightly under her stare.
He could not grasp what she was driving at. Death carried no clear
meaning to him. It had never touched his real inner life, and he
never thought of it. No matter how frightened he became, it never
occurred to him that he might cease to exist. Even his dreams had
no colouring of that kind.</p>
<p>In spite of his mother's anxiety, he learned to swim that
summer. He liked it and did it rather well for his age. But he
never ventured very far out. Rebel as he might against the check on
his movements, his mother's attitude had left a lasting mark on
him, and avoiding needless risks seemed a natural thing to him. As
a result of this inhibition, all his outdoor playing lacked that
complete abandon which is the soul of it. He been made an indoor
child beyond retrieve.</p>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="II_XIX"></a>XIX</h2>
<br>
<p>Being so much in the open air and moving about as a child
should, his nights during that summer passed mostly without dreams
of any kind, and also without other disturbances worth speaking of.
He was too healthily tired for anything but sleep.</p>
<p>The winter nights, following days spent largely indoors with
little company and less exercise, were quite different. Then the
passing from wakefulness to sleep took him through a dangerous
twilight period, when games of the kind learned behind the big rock
seemed not only natural, but the most enticing thing in the world.
And the more he was thrown back on his own resources, the more
tempting those games became. They represented, besides, something
that was entirely his own, with which no one else could interfere.
It was a secret that would have been the sweeter for being shared
with some one else, he felt, but Johan's peculiar attitude in this
matter had filled him with a shyness not his own by nature.</p>
<p>Then, with the sleep, came also the dreams. At first they were,
or seemed to be, mere plays of fancy--shadowy repetitions of
daylight experiences in clownish distortion. Then they began to
change. An element of unrest, and finally of dread, began to fill
them. This did not happen, however, until the same elements had
found a place in his waking life, and particularly not until the
hours of that twilight period had developed into a source of
increasingly acute conflict.</p>
<p>Nothing palpable had happened. Nothing had been said openly to
convince him that his secret was known and that it was evil. Yet
the air about him seemed full of suspicion and suspense and menace.
The mere way in which his mother looked at him at times filled his
soul with sinister misgivings. And she was always talking about
temptations and dangers that walk in the dark. Or else she dropped
mysterious warnings about the duty of keeping one's soul and body
clean and pure.</p>
<p>It was all very disturbing, and he should have liked to ask
questions, but always some imperious force within himself kept him
back. He felt that his sweet secret would never bear open
discussion, but the more desperately he clung to it, the more his
mind was poisoned with doubts out of which soon grew fears.</p>
<p>Thus began the new dream life.</p>
<p>He was as a rule the only living being in those dreams.
Everything else consisted of lifeless things, and mostly of spaces
and dimensions rather than of objects. The dominant characteristic
was an increase of size proportional to the increase of distance
from himself. He found himself, for instance, in the midst of a
vast space laid out in squares. Where he stood at the centre, those
squares were just large enough to hold him. Then, as his glance
passed outward, the squares became larger and larger, until at last
their dimensions became gigantic. Soon they began to move toward
him, growing smaller as they approached, and yet filling his soul
with a horror based entirely on the monstrous size of those squares
that were still miles away. Or he walked down a corridor built of
stones that, as it opened out in front of him, expanded
indefinitely until it assumed proportions that filled him with a
sickening sense of his own smallness. As he moved forward, the
corridor automatically contracted, but always the horror of those
immeasurable vastnesses still ahead of him continued dominant and
inevitable. At other times sums of figures came moving toward him
from every direction, and the farther away from him they were, the
more enormous they grew, until his mind no longer could take them
in, and his heart quaked at the thought that sooner or later one of
them would reach him in its original awe-inspiring immensity.</p>
<p>He tried once to tell his mother about those dreams, but found
it impossible to express what he wished to describe. Not long
afterwards he was aroused in the middle of the night by his mother
calling him by name. Her voice betrayed worry.</p>
<p>"What's the matter, Keith," she asked when at last he woke up
sufficiently to answer her call. "Were you dreaming?"</p>
<p>"I don't know," replied the boy, and at that moment he didn't
know.</p>
<p>"I thought first you were crying," explained the mother, "and
then I heard that you were counting something."</p>
<p>"He was probably repeating his multiplication table," muttered
the father. "I wish he would learn his lessons in the daytime, so
that we could sleep in peace at night."</p>
<p>The next morning Keith had forgotten all about it but his mother
reminded him of what had happened during the night in order to find
out whether he had any bad dreams. Keith shook his head. Then a
thought flashed through his mind.</p>
<p>"Do I often talk in my sleep," he asked.</p>
<p>"Hardly ever," said his mother. "But the other night you read
the Lord's Prayer from beginning to end, and I wish you would read
it as nicely when are saying your prayers before going to
sleep."</p>
<p>"He is studying too much," Granny put in from the kitchen. "His
nose is always buried in a book. That's the whole trouble, I tell
you."</p>
<p>"No, mamma, I don't think reading does him any harm," said
Keith's mother, and for some reason Keith felt relieved by the
diversion.</p>
<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 35%;">
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="II_XX"></a>XX</h2>
<br>
<p>Even Keith could not escape a feeling about this time of having
arrived at some sort of station or landmark on his road through
life.</p>
<p>He was frightfully self-centred. He seemed to be thinking about
nothing but himself. In reality, however, he was not reflecting at
all on the character and probable course of his life. It was all a
matter of feeling and what concerned him was merely the comforts or
discomforts, pleasures or pains, exhilarations or boredoms of the
passing moment. The future was a word that, at the most, implied
things that might happen a few days after tomorrow. The convinced
visioning of events a year or more distant was still utterly beyond
him. And the past seemed to vanish with the setting sun of the day
just ended.</p>
<p>Yet he was dimly aware of facing a transition that, somehow,
must make a great change in his entire life. Something that he
could not define was drawing to an end, and something else, equally
indefinable, was about to begin. The "school for small children"
which he had left, and the "school for boys" into which he would
soon enter, were the symbols used by his mind to express the
passing out of one phase of life into another, but as such they
suggested the actual change without revealing it. And there were
moments when Keith's vague efforts to look ahead were accompanied
by a sense of crushing dread, while at other times they might fill
him with a never before tasted fervor of existence.</p>
<p>He was near the completion of his ninth year. It seemed quite an
age, but this appearance was contradicted by troublesome facts. He
was very small for his age and hopelessly tied to the apron strings
of his mother in spite of all his father's efforts to pry him
loose. The reason for this failure was that his father lacked the
time or the capacity for winning the boy's whole-hearted attention
and affection.</p>
<p>The one thing the father seemed to care for on his return home
was to be left alone with his own preoccupations, and these did not
include the boy. He could not unbend. He could not subordinate his
own momentary desire or disinclination to an interest essentially
foreign to his own self. In other words, he was just as
self-centred as Keith, and just as unreflecting on the whole. Both
lived completely in the present, and both wished to escape from it.
The only difference between them was that while Keith sought his
escape in space, so to speak, by means of his books, the father's
only road of escape led him into a past of which the boy formed no
part.</p>
<p>Either through some fault of his own nature, or through the
restrictive policy of his parents, Keith at nine had formed no real
attachments outside of his immediate surroundings, and no life of
his own that was not enclosed by the walls of his childhood home.
This state of affairs tended always to throw him back on the mother
as his most satisfactory source of inspiration and the magnetic
pole of his emotional compass. And she on her part left no effort
untried that could help to fasten his affections more closely to
her.</p>
<p>Unconsciously but increasingly she worked to cut the boy off
from all the rest of the world in order that she might have him the
more exclusively to herself. She expressed openly the wish that he
might be a girl, because girls in those days were so much less
likely to escape the parental protection.</p>
<p>The boy was pleased by her attempts at monopolization. There was
something flattering and softly reassuring about her passionate
pleas for the uppermost place in his heart. And yet he rebelled
with increasing violence against the closeness of her clutch on
him. He seemed to choke at times, and a blind hatred rose within
him without ever revealing itself as in any way related to his
mother. One of the dominant emotions of this and the following
period of his life was one of intense impatience that seemed to be
directed toward no particular object. Once in a great while he
turned toward his father with an expectation of relief, but this
expectation was always foiled, and so he was plunged back again and
again into an inner life of his own that fed almost exclusively on
books and had little or nothing in common with the reality to which
the new school was supposed to form a gateway.</p>

<br>
<p>The new school was located in another part of the South End,
separated only by the churchyard from the old church of St. Mary
Magdalene. It was a state institution demanding an entrance fee,
which, although quite reasonable, yet sufficed to keep out the
children of mere wage earners. It was a school for the offspring of
the "better classes" and good enough for all but the most select
who must needs turn to certain private institutions of still
greater exclusiveness for instruction.</p>
<p>Its official title was St. Mary's Elementary School and it had
only five grades or classes, as they were called, being
supplemented by a "gymnasium," from which the pupils passed on to
the university. No boy was admitted under nine, but there seemed to
be no limit at the other end, for at the time of Keith's entrance
the upper grades still held a few youngsters with well developed
moustaches who, from the viewpoint of Keith's own peach-skinned
diminutiveness, looked like veritable patriarchs. Stories were
afloat about their actually being addressed as "mister" by the
teachers.</p>
<p>Admission was conditioned by examinations held in the school
itself, and thither Keith was escorted by his mother one late
August day. All novelties stimulated him, and to his inexperience
the rather dingy old school seemed enormously impressive. The mere
fact that it occupied a whole building all by itself was enough. In
addition, however, it had an assembly hall large enough to hold
several hundred boys, and there were numerous rooms capable of
holding thirty or forty boys. Every pupil had a seat and a small
desk of his own. Seeing these desks, with inkstands sunk into their
tops, and special grooves for the penholders, and lids that could
be raised, Keith knew that he must pass the examinations or die
from a broken heart.</p>
<p>The officiating teachers were stern but not unkind. Keith was
nervous from eagerness, but neither frightened nor embarrassed. The
questions asked were ridiculously easy, he thought. When his turn
came, he answered triumphantly, as if he had been playing a game in
which he was quite skilled. Finding him willing and well prepared,
the examiners felt themselves challenged and pressed him more and
more. Still he held his own. It ended with a sense of triumph on
his part, but nothing was said about his having passed.</p>
<p>The wait that followed until all the boys had been questioned
was the only difficult part of the ordeal. Waiting patiently was
not a strong point with Keith. Finally his mother appeared to take
him home, and the moment he looked at her he knew. She was in such
high spirits that she had to try a joke.</p>
<p>"Too bad you couldn't pass," she said in a voice she vainly
tried to make sad.</p>
<p>He knew it was a joke, and yet his heart leaped into his throat
and his eyes filled with tears. Then she had to console him, and to
do so, she let out the whole story. The teachers had told her that
he knew enough to go right into the third grade, but on account of
his age they had advised her not to let him start above the second
grade. It was a whole year saved, but that was not what she was
thinking of. Her son had distinguished himself by giving proof of a
brightness that had aroused unusual attention among the teachers.
Her pride in this fact was such that Keith really began to think
that a new life was about to begin for him.</p>
<p>And that night, when his father came home, the whole story had
to be told over again with new details, and Keith had the pleasure
of seeing an expression of undisguised satisfaction on his father's
face. It did not last very long, but it was sweet to watch while it
lasted. Then the father resumed his usual manner of stern
indifference as he turned to the boy:</p>
<p>"That's all very well, Keith, but it means also that they will
expect more of you than of the other boys, and so you have to study
harder than ever in order to make good with them."</p>
<p>Keith didn't care. It had been a wonderful day, he felt. He had
had his first taste of public approval, and he had noticed the
effect of it on his father and mother. As for the need of
studying--that was easy. And he didn't have to begin his studies at
once anyhow.</p>
<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 35%;">
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="III_II"></a>II</h2>
<br>
<p>After the opening of the term, it took Keith only a day or two
to realize that, literally, he had entered a new world, quite
different, in spirit as well as in appearance, from anything
previously experienced.</p>
<p>The first shock came as soon as he had taken his place in the
class and the first lesson had begun. He was no longer Keith.
Christian names were not at all in use. Everybody was addressed by
his family name both by the teachers and by his fellow pupils.
Keith had become Wellander, and the first time he heard himself
called by that name he blushed as deeply as if his most intimate
privacy had suddenly been violated. In a few hours, however, the
unfamiliarity of the name as a standing appellation had worn off,
and then the pride of the thing sent a pleasant glow through his
whole body, making him for a brief, dizzy moment glimpse the glory
of manhood.</p>
<p>His next discovery went far deeper. He had attended school four
years in succession, but only as you drop into a strange room on a
visit. He had never belonged in or to the school, and the school
had neither limited nor extended his individuality. Now he found
himself completely taken possession of and made a part of something
larger than himself, a carefully correlated and guarded system of
ranks and rules and traditions. In retrospect the former school
seemed as accidental and fleeting as a street crowd, while the new
one was an institution with a jealously preserved and deeply
revered history to which each new pupil was expected to add more
lustre. But most remarkable of all seemed the fact that this
collective body added something to the stature of every boy that
became a part of it.</p>
<p>Membership was as onerous as it was honourable, not only within
the school precints but anywhere. To belong to "Old Mary" was to
carry a sacred duty along wherever one went. She was like an
ambitious parent, never jealous of the reputation of her children.
Mostly it was a question of refraining from this or that thing
which less conspicuously placed boys might venture at will, but at
times it might imply the performance of fierce deeds of bravery in
the face of overwhelming odds. There was the rival school of St.
Catherine and several "popular" schools that had no social standing
whatsoever, but contained pupils with harder fists and less
generous ideas of fighting than any boy within Old Mary. When
certain words of derision were flung upon the air by members of
those inferior institutions, there was nothing left for a pupil of
St. Mary's but to fight.</p>
<p>Little by little these strange facts penetrated Keith's
subconsciousness and set up a never ending conflict between pride
and precaution, between his wish to rise to a new ideal and his
instinctive tendency to obey his mother's almost hysterical
injunctions against fighting of any kind. Fortunately his road to
and from school permitted him to follow the principal streets where
the traffic was sufficient to act as a check on combative
youngsters, and an additional protection was derived from his small
size which caused the hostile elements to overlook his existence
unless he appeared in the company of more developed schoolmates.
And as he mostly walked alone, his comings and goings were
uneventful as a rule. But that did not prevent him from imagining
dangers and to suffer from them almost as much as if they had been
real. There were times when he could not help thinking of himself
as a coward.</p>
<p>Such estimates of himself were not wholly checked by an incident
that occurred within the school precincts early in the first term.
There was another boy in the same class named Bauer, who seemed the
living counterpart of Keith--just as undersized and lonely and
nervous. From the first there was a hostile tension between those
two, and soon it came to open war. It broke out in a pause between
two lessons when practically all the boys were gathered in the
schoolyard. Before Keith quite knew what had happened, he found
himself fighting Bauer. First they used their fists and then they
wrestled. The rest of the boys formed a ring about them and egged
them on.</p>
<p>They were well matched in their common weaknesses and both
developed a certain courage during the stress of conflict. The
difference between them was that Bauer apparently wanted to lick
Keith, while the latter thought of nothing but to defend himself.
The idea of inflicting pain on another human being was so foreign
to Keith that it never took tangible form in his mind. The result
was that Bauer's greater aggressiveness carried the day, and soon
Keith found himself prone on his back with a triumphant Bauer
straddling his chest.</p>
<p>At that moment both boys became guilty of serious breaches
against time-honoured school etiquette. Bauer struck the
defenceless Keith square in the face with his clenched fist, and
Keith burst into tears. Quick as a flash one of the older boys
grabbed Bauer by the scruff of his neck and hurled him halfway
across the yard, while another one plucked Keith from the ground
and shoved him toward the stairway with a contemptuous:</p>
<p>"The classroom for cry-babies."</p>
<p>The humiliation felt by Keith was so intense that he wondered
whether he could stay in the school. Nothing but the thought of his
father kept him from returning home. But the cloud had a silver
lining. Though no one else knew, he knew that he had started crying
from rage, and not from fear. And this fact in connection with his
realization of not having had any thought of running away during
the fight made him hesitate in his final judgment upon himself. But
he felt quite sure that fighting was not his chosen field. The
effect on his nerves was too damaging.</p>

<br>
<p>In the lower three grades, a single teacher with the title of
Class Principal had complete charge of the morals, manners and
instruction of the children in his grade. Keith had the luck of
falling into the hands of one of the kindest and shrewdest men in
the school--a man who seemed to understand that his mission was to
guide rather than to drive, and who, in addition to his broad,
human sympathy, possessed a genuine sense of humour.</p>
<p>His name was Lector Dahlstr&ouml;m, but everybody spoke of him
as Dally, and little did he care. He was large of body and large of
mind, with a most impressive girth and a voice that commanded
attention without grating on supersensitive nerves. He had very
rarely to assert his authority, but if ever the need arose, no one
remained long in doubt as to who was the master, and a recurrence
of the offense was unheard of. Even on such occasions he never used
corporal punishment, although at that time the right of such
administration still remained with him. He simply appealed to the
self-respect and the sense of fairness in his pupils, asking no one
to render what lay beyond his capacity. The main secret of his hold
on the boys, however, lay in his ability to keep them interested,
and to do so he frequently broke away from the text books and
time-worn pedagogical methods. If there was anything he deposed, it
was learning things by rote.</p>
<p>The boys sat in rows of four and were placed with regard to
scholarship and behaviour, so that the best pupils were farthest
away from the teacher and the least reliable ones right in front of
him. Keith found himself number two in the class, and that position
at first tickled his pride considerably. Later, as the term went
by, and boys now and then were shifted up or down, he began to
wonder why he always remained number two. It was reassuring in a
way, as showing that he held his own, but he failed to see why
another boy should always remain <i>primus</i>, although his
performances during lessons did not surpass those of Keith. Once he
dared even give utterance to some such speculation in his father's
hearing, but was promptly put down with a stern:</p>
<p>"If the teacher puts another boy above you, he has probably some
very good reason for doing so, and you had better feel thankful for
being where you are in the class."</p>
<p>"Humph," said his mother. "You forget, Carl, that the father of
that boy is one of the richest bankers in the city."</p>
<p>This was a way of looking at it which had never occurred to
Keith. He was pretty contented, on the whole, and like all the
rest, he placed the most implicit trust in the teacher's justice.
From the very start, he had a feeling that Dally kept a special eye
on him, and yet he was rarely spoken to except when questions were
passed around. Even then the teacher was rather apt to leave Keith
alone to such an extent that the boy now and then began to think
himself disliked. Always, however, when he got to this point, some
little incident would occur that restored his faith both in himself
and in the teacher.</p>
<p>There could be no doubt that he knew his lessons as well as any
one in the class, if not better, and he shone still more when Dally
appealed to the natural intelligence of the boys by straying far
away from the beaten and dusty path of the text books. Whenever he
had stirred them by some excursion of this kind and began to ask
questions in order to find out how far they had followed him,
Keith's right hand was sure to shoot excitedly upwards in order to
get him the coveted chance of answering. And it seemed as if he
could answer almost every question asked except a few that went so
far beyond the bounds laid down for the class that the teacher
deemed it fair to warn them that inability to answer would be no
shame. That was the kind of questions Dally generally reserved for
Keith, and when Keith couldn't answer, it didn't console him very
much that no one else could. Once, when his hand went up as usual
and, to his astonishment, he obtained the permission to answer,
Keith, to his still greater astonishment, suddenly discovered that
he had no answer to give.</p>
<p>"I thought so," said Dally with a broad grin on his
good-humoured face. "Do you know what a fuzzy-wuzz is,
Wellander?"</p>
<p>Keith shook his head, his face crimson with chagrin and
humiliation as the whole class burst into anticipatory
laughter.</p>
<p>"That's a chap who wants to do all of it all the time,"
explained Dally.</p>
<p>Keith did not quite see the point, but he kept his right arm a
little more in check for a while after that, until one day the
lesson was forgotten and history repeated itself.</p>
<p>"Now Keith is fuzzy-wuzzying again," said Dally, and Keith
thought he would sink through the floor. His mind was quite made up
never to ask permission to answer another question again, but that
same afternoon, during the lesson in Swedish history, Dally dropped
all questioning and asked Keith to explain to the class the main
factors leading up to the Wars of Reformation--which Keith spent
twenty minutes in doing while all the rest of the class had to sit
still listening to him.</p>

<br>
<p>Keith could not remain isolated to the same extent as in the
earlier schools. Inevitable community sprang from similarity of sex
and age alone. In the same direction worked the system of teaching
which called for the united attention of the entire class during
every moment of the lesson. It was impossible to form a part of the
class without being in contact with all its other members. The boy
who read aloud or answered a question became subjected to the
criticism or admiration of all the rest. Rivalry in any field of
study was just as likely to arise between two boys at different
ends of the room as between those sitting side by side. The spirit
of Dally tended to assist this fusion of personalities in every
way, and the boy who kept apart was sure sooner or later to run
foul of his good-humoured but well-aimed sallies. His attitude
implied no tyranny, and he strove for no deadening conformity. On
the contrary, he always spoke of a strongly marked individuality as
the object of all education, but he tried to develop it by fearless
contact with others rather than by jealous withdrawal.</p>
<p>Keith for the first time found himself part of a society, and he
liked it because the teacher's insistence on scholarly achievement
as the only standard of comparison gave him a chance to hold his
own among a group of boys, most of whom counted themselves his
superiors in every other respect. He was small and poor, of humble
origin, without influential connections, without worldly advantages
of any kind, but when mind was pitched against mind, he felt second
to none--except in mathematics, where he could compete neither with
Davidson, the Jewish banker's son who was <i>primus</i>, or with
that gawky, cumbersome Anderson whose dullness in every other
respect always kept him near the bottom of the class. For this
reason Keith differed from most of the others by liking school
better during the lessons than at any other time.</p>
<p>There were games in the schoolyard during the pauses, and some
of these were played in large groups or by teams. This occurred
particularly when echoes from some war abroad caused the whole
school to divide into rival armies for the staging of regular
battles, as during his second year, when all had to be Turks or
Russians. But Keith didn't like battles except in books, and mostly
the pauses broke up the class communities into small coteries or
pairs. And the moment this happened, Keith found himself outside.
He belonged to no special group. His appearance in the yard raised
no delighted hails. He had no chum of his very own with whom to
exchange secrets or lay plans for common adventures. And but for
Dally, he would probably have spent most of his free time in the
classroom.</p>
<p>It was worse when the big pause came at eleven and every one
went home for lunch, or when three o'clock brought school to a
close for the day. Going to school alone was an experience shared
by all, but on leaving it, the hurrying horde of youngsters,
exuberant with freedom as so many colts, broke into little groups
of two or three that had homes in the same neighbourhood. Now and
then Keith would join a couple of other boys headed for the old
City like himself, and they would not refuse his company, but there
always was something between him and them that precluded real
fellowship, and so he trudged his way homeward, alone most of the
time. Then he was also sure of reaching home in the shortest
possible time, so that his mother had no chance to become worried
over him.</p>
<p>It happen now and then that a larger group was formed for some
unusual exploit and that Keith became part of it by chance rather
than choice. Once he accompanied such a group to that part of the
harbour where tall-masted fullriggers with foreign flags lay nose
by stern in unbroken line along the quay. Strange odours, fragrant
or repulsive, filled the air. Jolly, loud-voiced men toiled
mightily or lounged like monarchs among piles of casks and bags and
boxes. For once Keith lost his usual timidity under such
circumstances and threw himself whole-heartedly into anything the
gang suggested. He even ventured to climb the mast of a ship as far
as the foretop. When at last reluctantly he turned homeward, he
felt like a hero, but when he caught sight of the tear-stained,
fretted face of his mother, he knew at once that even such
exaltation was not worth the price to be paid for it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately he had made himself popular that afternoon, and
the next time a gang formed for a similar purpose, he was asked to
join. But he shook his head, and being foolishly truthful by
nature, he blurted out an embarrassed:</p>
<p>"My mother won't let me."</p>
<p>The answer was passed along. It was repeated in school the next
day. Keith heard echoes of it for weeks. And it added a good deal
to the invisible wall that seemed to rise about him wherever he
went.</p>
<p>Yet he was not unhappy. There was in his nature a wonderful
resiliency that never let his spirits drop beyond a certain point,
and that always brought them back to highwater mark at the
slightest encouragement.</p>

<br>
<p>He had discovered the school library. It was to him a marvellous
treasure trove. Any book could be taken home, one at a time, after
being registered with the teacher acting as librarian for the day.
Nor were the books handed out to you arbitrarily. You browsed all
by yourself, and picked and picked, and calculated, and went back
on your choice a dozen times, until at last you struck a book so
fascinating in its promises that all hesitation disappeared.</p>
<p>The father started to object, but was silenced by the
explanation that the school authorities wanted the boys to borrow
books from the library. That settled it, for discipline came first
and even pleasure must be allowed if required by discipline. Had
Keith been less honest or more imaginative in what may be called
practical matters, his father's regard for authority might have
offered more than one chance at liberties now denied, but this
possibility never occurred to him, and so the library remained his
one avenue of escape.</p>
<p>The books he chose puzzled and almost shocked the rotatory
guardians of his sanctum. Once he picked an enormous volume on
Greek mythology, full of pictures and translated passages from
Homer and the dramatists.</p>
<p>"You don't want that, Wellander," the teacher said, eying him
curiously, when Keith presented the book for registration.</p>
<p>"Yes, I do," replied Keith stoutly, but his heart began to quake
at the thought that the cherished volume was going to be denied
him.</p>
<p>"Do you mean to say that you intend to read it through?" the
teacher persisted.</p>
<p>"Yes, I will," said Keith.</p>
<p>There was a long pause during which the teacher seemed to weigh
the book in his hand as if wondering whether its very weight would
be too much for the undersized little chap in front of him.</p>
<p>"All right," he said at last, "but I suppose that means you will
have reading for the rest of this season."</p>
<p>Keith looked at the book more hopefully, and with hope came
courage.</p>
<p>"I'll read it in three weeks," he said.</p>
<p>So he did, too, and when he turned in the book, the same teacher
happened to be on duty, recognized him, and began to ask questions.
When Keith had proved that the whole Olympian hierarchy was duly
installed in his acquisitive brain, the teacher said with an amused
but friendly smile:</p>
<p>"I think we shall let you have anything you want hereafter. What
is it to be this time--philosophy?"</p>
<p>"No, I want another book of exploration," answered Keith,
thawing under the smile. "And I want a real good one."</p>
<p>That was his favourite subject, and the book he chose was
Speke's "Discovery of the Source of the Nile." Once launched on
that memorable journey, he had no thought left for any explorations
of his own.</p>
<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 35%;">
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="III_VI"></a>VI</h2>
<br>
<p>During the fall and spring terms of that first year Keith had no
sense of time. Days and weeks and months rolled by so smoothly that
their passing was unnoticed. It is a question whether at any other
period of his life--with one possible exception--he was more
completely interested and, for that reason, satisfied.</p>
<p>One day he observed casually that the old trees in the
churchyard sported tiny green leaves under a deliciously blue but
still rather cold sky. A few days more, and he heard that
commencement was at hand.</p>
<p>It was a time of great excitement in school. Who would pass and
who would not? Falling through might mean another year in the same
class, but beyond all doubt it meant a summer spent at work instead
of playing. It was worse than a disgrace. It was a menace to
liberty at the time of the year when liberty meant most.</p>
<p>Being second in the class, it never occurred to Keith that he
might fail of promotion to a higher grade, but at that end there
were possible prizes to consider. The class was full of gossip and
speculation. Boys who had hardly spoken to each other before broke
into heated discussions or formed belated friendships. In one way
and another the fever infected Keith and spread from him to his
parents, though his father as usual feigned complete indifference.
From his mother he learned long before the startling fact was meant
to reach his ears, that his father had actually asked a day off at
the bank in order to attend the exercises. This news increased
Keith's fear by several degrees. He had no idea what might happen,
and it would be unthinkably dreadful to have the father present if
anything went wrong. But on the other hand, if ... well, what was
there to happen anyhow?</p>
<p>On the morning of the great day, a host of parents and relatives
and other interested spectators crowded into the big assembly hall
where places were reserved for them in the rear and along the
walls. In the meantime the pupils gathered in their respective
class-rooms, and from there they marched by twos to the hall, the
lowest grade leading. Every boy was in his best clothes, and every
one showed his nervousness in his own peculiar way. Keith laughed
hysterically a few times before they started, and then he turned
into an automaton that breathed and moved and heard and saw only as
part of a gigantic machine. His own individuality seemed to melt
and become a mere drop in the all-exclusive individuality of the
school.</p>
<p>This mood lasted through the early part of the exercises, the
prayer read by the <i>primus</i> of the senior class, the hymn
singing, the Rector's speech, and so on. Everything came to him as
out of a mist, and he was not even sufficiently conscious of
himself to look around for a glimpse of his parents. When the
distribution of exercises began, the whole atmosphere changed.
Until then it had been collective and impersonal. Now it became
intensely personal. Every one wanted to hear. Necks were craned,
whispered questions asked. It was as if a sudden breeze had stirred
waters which until then had been still as the mirroring surface of
a forest pool. Keith's mood changed with the rest, and he grew
painfully conscious of himself and his surroundings.</p>
<p>Starting with the lowest grade, the Rector read out the names of
the prize winners, the character of the prizes, and sometimes the
reasons why they were bestowed. At the mention of each name, a boy
rose from his seat, squirmed past his closely packed comrades,
marched up the centre aisle to the platform, bowed awkwardly to the
Rector, grabbed the prize, bowed still more awkwardly if possible,
and marched back to his seat with a face that burned or blanched,
grinned or glowed, according to temperament.</p>
<p>The second grade was soon reached. Most of the prizes consisted
of books. Davidson, <i>primus</i>, got two gilt-edged volumes of
poetry. Keith caught a glimpse of them and experienced a twinge of
envy. His heart was beating so that he thought he could hear it.
His eyes clung to the Rector's mouth, and when the next name was
read, he half rose. Then he sank back, and around him an ominous
stillness seemed to reign.</p>
<p>The name was that of Runge, <i>tertius</i>, who got some
historical work. Then <i>quartus</i>, Blomberg, who was a
passionate botanist, received a valuable text book on his favourite
subject. Still the rector went on, and Keith felt sure that his
name had been passed over by some mistake, and that now it would
come.</p>
<p>"A German lexicon for special attention to the student of that
language," the Rector droned on.</p>
<p>Again Keith started to rise from his seat, but even as he did
so, it flashed through his mind that he was given no more attention
to German than to other studies.</p>
<p>"... to Otto Krass of the Second Grade," the Rector completed
his sentence, holding out a book.</p>
<p>As Keith sank back on the bench, Krass, <i>quintus</i>, rose
with an expression on his face as if he had become personally
involved in a particularly incredible miracle.</p>
<p>A whisper ran through the rest of the class. Glances were cast
at Keith, who felt them like so many lashes on bare skin although
in every other respect he had once more become utterly unconscious
of what happened about him.</p>
<p>By slow degrees he recovered so far that he could try to think,
but the process was unendurable. There could be no accident. It was
a deliberate slight aimed at him for some specific reason. He tried
to think of the past year and its happenings in and out of school,
but this effort produced no solution to the riddle.</p>
<p>Suddenly he bethought himself of his speculations concerning his
place in the class. It seemed that he had been deeply envious of
Davidson all that year. With a quick turn of the head he surveyed
for a moment the haughty expression and narrowly drawn postures of
the boy beside him. There was a trace of a sneer on that face, and
again Keith's heart was flooded with resentment. But this mood
changed abruptly into contriteness. Perhaps he was being punished
by some one, by God--he hesitated at that thought--for grudging his
schoolmate the place and the honours that he probably had deserved.
Keith was the meanest of the mean....</p>
<p>Krass was back in his seat showing his book. He showed it to
Keith also, but with a palpable embarrassment that touched the
latter as an additional blow. Keith tried to say that it was nice,
but his lips were too dry and stiff to produce a sound.</p>
<p>The Rector was still reading off names. To save himself from his
own thoughts, Keith tried to listen. Soon he noticed that, without
fail, the prizes went in unbroken sequence to the first four or
five pupils in every grade. And suddenly he wondered whether his
father and mother had noticed. What would they say? What could
<i>he</i> say?</p>
<p>Then he remembered his mother's remark on hearing about his
place in the class, and he wondered if it could be possible.... But
the parents of Krass had neither wealth nor position. That much he
knew.</p>
<p>The Rector's voice and manner became more and more impressive,
and the prizes more and more valuable, as he passed higher and
higher, until at last the senior class was reached--the boys who
were now graduating into the <i>gymnasium</i>. They were his own
pupils, and for each of the prize winners from the two branches of
that class he had a word of special praise and good-will.</p>
<p>A restless stirring passed through the assembly as the boy
expected to be the last recipient of special honours made his way
to the platform and everybody prepared to rise for the singing of a
closing hymn.</p>
<p>Still the old Rector, with his smooth-shaven and deeply furrowed
Roman face, remained standing, and once more an expectant hush fell
upon pupils and spectators. Apparently he intended, contrary to
custom, to follow up the main ceremony of the day with some
important announcement.</p>
<p>"One more prize remains to be distributed," he resumed with more
than usual deliberation. "We do not have the pleasure of bestowing
it regularly, because its conditions are unusual. It was the will
of the donor that it should be given to that pupil who, regardless
of grade and age, during the previous year had shown the relatively
greatest aptitude, industry, and actual advance in knowledge. This
year the prize, which consists of one hundred crowns in gold and is
the largest at the disposal of our school, is to be distributed,
and the pupil found worthy of this exceptional honour is...."</p>
<p>Every eye was on the Rector as he paused dramatically. Every one
in the hall listened breathlessly to catch the favoured name. Keith
listened like the rest, a little enviously perhaps, but without
serious attention, for it had just occurred to him for the tenth
time that the situation would have been so much less unbearable if
only his father had stayed away.</p>
<p>"... this pupil is Keith Wellander of the Second Grade," the
Rector concluded.</p>
<p>A murmur swept the hall, and Keith felt himself the centre of
many eyes. The murmur grew as the winner failed to appear, but
Keith could not move a limb. Dumbly and unbelievingly he stared at
the Rector and the group of teachers seated around him on the
platform.</p>
<p>"Come forward, Wellander," the Rector said in a friendly voice
as if he could well understand the overwhelming effect of such
distinction. At the same time Keith noticed Lector Dahlstr&ouml;m
rising partly from his seat on the platform as if to see whether
anything might be the matter.</p>
<p>Had the ceiling opened and an angel appeared in a fiery chariot
to call him heavenward, the boy could not have been more startled.
It was as if a terrific blow had paralyzed all his senses. His
classmates had to push him forward. He never knew how he reached
the platform, where the Rector was waiting for him with a small
package ready for delivery. Keith felt the weight of that package
in his own hand and the gentle touch of the Rector's hand on his
head. Words were uttered that he did not catch, and the room became
filled with the noise of boisterous applause.</p>
<p>He bowed mechanically and turned to walk back to his seat, and
as he did so, he noticed a white handkerchief waving at him from
the rear of the hall. Behind the handkerchief he caught a glimpse
of his mother's face, and a thought shot through his head:</p>
<p>"Papa is here and has heard all this!"</p>
<p>Then he relapsed into a state of utter oblivion of the
surrounding world. The thing was too tremendous to be felt even.
Automatically he moved out of the hall and back to the classroom
with the rest. Dally was saying things to him, but he could not
grasp a word. Now and then he became vaguely conscious of awed
glances cast at him by the other boys. Some of them spoke to him,
and in some strange way he managed to realize that Davidson was not
among these.</p>
<p>At last he woke into full consciousness on the street, where he
found himself walking homeward by his father's hand. The pressure
of that hand seemed unusually soft and pleasant. The mother was
talking eagerly and wiping her eyes between little happy bursts of
laughter. The father listened for a long while in silence.</p>
<p>"Yes," he said at last, "it is not a bad beginning--if he can
keep it up."</p>
<p>Keith felt for a moment as if he were walking on air, and he
knew that he would keep it up--that after such a day nothing could
prevent him from keeping it up. Then a bewildering thought appeared
out of nowhere and began to buzz in his tired and over-excited
brain.</p>
<p>"If I have done all that the Rector said," this thought demanded
of him, "why in the world has Dally kept me sitting below Davidson
who got nothing but books?"</p>
<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 35%;">
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="III_VII"></a>VII</h2>
<br>
<p>Keith next day was permitted to have a good look at the five
twenty-crown pieces found in the package handed to him by the
Rector. Their weight and brightness made them delightful to handle,
but they were not "toys for children" his father remarked, and with
that remark they passed out of sight for ever. Once or twice he put
timid questions to his mother, who never answered directly, but
reminded him of all the money his father had spent and was spending
on him for food and clothes and schooling and all sorts of things.
Keith almost wished that he had received some nice books instead,
or anything that could make him feel that he really had got a big
glorious reward for something he really had done. Now the
achievement seemed as illusive as the reward.</p>
<p>He tried to reason the case out with himself, and the conclusion
at which he arrived was that his father probably was entitled and
certainly welcome to the money, but that as he, Keith, had earned
it and owned it, something should be said to him about the use of
it. And as so often was the case, it became a question of abstract
justice. The value and possibilities of the money lay beyond his
grasp, but the ethics of its disposal, from his simple childish
point of view, seemed too clear for serious discussion. Once or
twice he stole a look at his savings bank book, which his mother
kept among her own papers, but no new entry appeared on its meagre
credit side. By and by he almost lost sight of the whole incident,
engrossed as he was with the experiences of the current hour, but
the memory of it recurred fitfully, and in moments of
dissatisfaction it tended to assume the shape of a grievance, if
not a charge, against the father. From this tendency he fled
instinctively to an idea of money as not worth bothering about. And
that idea also helped when the atmosphere of worry about money
matters surrounding his mother became too intense and
depressive.</p>
<p>There was comparatively little of it that summer. His mother was
in better health and spirits than he had seen her for a long time,
and she was as happy as Keith when the father announced that they
would have a summer place of their own on one of the islands in
Lake Maelaren, somewhat farther out than the one where Uncle Laube
lived. It was too far away to have become absorbed by the rapidly
growing city, and yet too close at hand to be quite desirable as a
summer location for the more prosperous. The island was of
sufficient size to hold a couple of real farms in the centre, while
the shore line was occupied by occasional villas. Halfway between
these two mutually foreign regions, on a sharp slope that still
remained largely uncleared, stood a little red house with just two
rooms in it. One of these was occupied by the old couple that owned
the house. The other one had been rented to the Wellanders for the
summer, and in that one room the mother, the grandmother and Keith
established themselves, with the father appearing as a regular
week-end guest.</p>
<p>Taking it all in all, it was the freest, and in many ways the
happiest summer of Keith's childhood. He was permitted to roam
around pretty much as he pleased, and there were several other
small boys to play with, none of them enterprising enough to arouse
the distrust of Keith's mother. They were all city boys however, as
foreign to nature as Keith, and there was no older person on hand
to give their excursions and games a constructive twist without
turning them into lessons. There was plenty of wild life about, and
it helped in many ways to give them a better time, but that was as
near as they got to it. Exactly the same thing happened during
subsequent summers, and so the boy always looked upon flowers and
trees and birds and insects as delightful but puzzling
representatives of a world of which he did not know the
language.</p>
<p>It was good fun, however, and temporarily it took Keith farther
away from himself and from his cherished books than he had been
since his first discovery of the latter. The boys proved decent,
wholesome company, more bent on discharging their surplus energy
than on doing mischief. Much of their time was spent in or near the
water, so that Keith developed into a pretty good swimmer for his
age, though always of the cautious type. And between games they
would discuss the world from a boy's point of view. There was
particularly one boy of the same age as Keith with whom he had
talks of a kind quite new to him. Oscar's parents were still very
young, and he spoke of them more as chums than as masters. And he
spoke of them with a sort of restrained enthusiasm that set Keith
thinking very hard. He loved his parents, especially his mother,
and admired them, especially his father at certain times, but he
was not conscious of any feeling about them corresponding to the
one displayed by Oscar, whose father, after all, was nothing but a
captain on one of the small steam sloops running between the city
and some of the surrounding islands.</p>
<p>Oscar was especially eloquent when he spoke of the love his
parents had for each other. He gave examples that seemed
exaggerated to Keith, but nevertheless impressed him. In return
Keith boasted similarly of his own parents, and he meant every word
he said, but always what he had to tell fell short of the pictures
drawn by Oscar.</p>
<p>"You don't understand," cried Oscar one day when again they were
debating this fascinating topic all by themselves. "It's all right
for your mother to kiss your father when he leaves and when he
returns, and to be looking for him all the time. But that's not
enough. That's not the way my parents love each other. And I don't
think your father cares so very much for your mother. But my father
is so much in love with my mother that he would like to eat what
she has chewed!"</p>
<p>"No--o!" protested Keith, rather appalled by the illustration
used, and yet feeling as if he had beheld some undiscovered
country. There was a pause during which he stared incredulously at
Oscar.</p>
<p>"I mean just what I said," insisted Oscar a little more quietly
after a while. "Anything that has to do with my mother is sweet to
my father, I tell you. And that is love. If you don't know it, you
don't know what love is either."</p>
<p>"But why," demanded Keith, his mind still so full of the
disturbing image called forth by Oscar that his jaws moved uneasily
as if he had taken into his mouth something unpalatable.</p>
<p>"Because," Oscar hesitated ... "because it is that way."</p>
<p>Keith left shortly afterwards to think it over in solitude. It
was probably the first time the word love had been presented to him
as anything but a commonplace term for laudable but commonplace
feelings. He puzzled over it, but to little purpose, and for some
reason he thought it useless or unwise to ask his mother for
information.</p>

<br>
<p>The third grade proved merely a continuation of the second.
Little had changed over summer. A few boys had been dropped behind
and a few others overtaken. That affected the bottom of the class,
but not the top. Dally remained their principal, and when he
welcomed them back at the opening of the fall term, Keith waited
excitedly for the distribution of places. Few changes were made
however. Davidson remained <i>primus</i> as before, with Keith
next. Then came Runge and Blomberg as before. For a day or two
Keith swung violently between fits of rebellion and deep
depression. It seemed almost incredible that he could have received
the highest prize bestowed on any pupil in the school.</p>
<p>Then the routine of instruction and study seized him. New
text-books were acquired, not without some grumbling on his
father's part. New interests were stirring and, as usual, cleverly
nursed by Dally. Above all, the magnetic power of the teacher
asserted itself once more, until Keith felt that the only thing
really worth while in life was to please him.</p>
<p>Algebra was one of the new subjects, and the use of letters
instead of figures amused Keith for a while. But it took no serious
hold on his mind. The whole field of mathematics left him strangely
uninterested although he was good at arithmetic. He thought the
problems of Euclid stupid. Once he had learned how to prove a
theorem, it seemed so ridiculously self-evident that he wondered
why anybody should bother his brain about it. There were other boys
who could figure out the demonstrations in advance without looking
at the book. Keith tried it once or twice, but failed miserably and
gave it up as a worthless and thankless job. Apparently his brain
did not work in that way. It had to touch real life to be at its
best. History and geography were his favourite subjects, and in
those he led the class. This was openly admitted by Dally
himself.</p>
<p>Literature was another new subject. They read and analysed and
criticized classical Swedish poetry--Tegn&eacute;r and Runeberg and
Geijer. Most of the poems chosen for the purpose were historical
and took their themes from the old viking days or from the glorious
centuries of Gustavus Adolphus and Charles XII, when Sweden so
nearly rose to be a great power. Keith liked to take certain
sonorous passages into his mouth. There was a satisfying fullness
and richness about them that seemed somehow to enhance his own
feeling of self-importance. Their rhythm also pleased him and
became a sort of substitute for the singing of which he was
incapable. Chiefly, however, it was the stories told by the poems
that interested him, and on the whole he did not think much of
poetry. But this opinion he never dared to put into words. To do so
in the face of Dally's clearly manifested reverence would have been
like openly confessing a particularly degrading form of
inferiority.</p>
<p>Nor did it seem to matter so very much what he studied. The main
thing always remained what Dally said and did in his efforts to
bring out something within the self of each boy for which only he
seemed to have an eye. Keith at times felt as if he would give
anything to know what Dally expected of him in particular. He felt
sure that it must be something wonderful, and he had odd moments of
almost being on the verge of grasping it, but in the end it always
eluded him, and no sooner was he out of Dally's presence than the
whole thing seemed very unreal and foolish.</p>

<br>
<p>Young Davidson had a bent toward sarcasm that sometimes lured
him out of his usual cold aloofness. In one of these rare
communicative moments he said of little Loth that he crossed the
equator at least once a week and didn't mind. He referred to the
fact that Loth was more frequently moved than any other pupil but
always managed to retain a place near the centre. And no matter
what fate might bring him of ups or downs, Loth always retained a
perfect composure. Yet he was small and nervous and highstrung like
Keith and Bauer. One day Keith asked him how he could stand being
shoved about like that.</p>
<p>"Because my father says I am going into business anyhow,"
answered Loth, "and I don't know whether I hate business or books
most."</p>
<p>"What would you like to do," asked Keith looking puzzled.</p>
<p>"Draw," said Loth vaguely, "and play the piano, and go to the
theatre, and--yes, and read poetry books that don't teach you
anything."</p>
<p>This view of life was so new to Keith that he really tried to
become acquainted with Loth in order to learn more about it. His
own indifference to anything but books promised small success, but
in the end a tie was found in their common love of tin soldiers. So
he was admitted to Loth's particular circle and was even invited to
Loth's home for a birthday party--the first and last of its kind
that he attended during his five years at Old Mary. Before
permitted to go, he was warned that the servant girl would come for
him at nine. No amount of pleading helped to ameliorate that
condition.</p>
<p>Loth's father was a prosperous storekeeper on West Long Street
and lived in a spacious and richly furnished apartment above the
store. It was a home like that revealed to Keith through his
shortlived friendship with Harald. The impression on Keith,
however, was quite different because of his own growth since that
first year at school. And the actions of the eight or ten boys who
were the other guests impressed him still more. They wore gloves
when they arrived. They showed neither forwardness nor timidity,
but greeted each other and their host with grown-up dignity and
formality. They seemed to know what to do at every moment, and how
to do it. Keith was accustomed to decent manners. Social
intercourse in the parental circle was not without grace, but this
was something different. At the time he was utterly incapable of
telling where the difference lay, and years afterward he realized
what subtle shadings it depended on. The main thing at the time was
that something in himself responded instinctively to the higher
degree of polish and self-assurance which he now for the first time
was able to observe at close quarters.</p>
<p>The principal entertainment of the evening was a monster battle
with tin soldiers on the cleared floor of the huge dining-room. The
battle was at its height and supper was not yet in sight, when
Keith learned that the girl was waiting for him. There was nothing
to do but to obey, but the hostess could not think of letting him
go without having eaten. A special service was prepared for him in
the kindest way possible, and Keith enjoyed very much the many
dainties offered him. Nevertheless he felt the situation as
humiliating and was actually glad when he got away at last. But the
gladness was only a surface gloss on a burning core of regrets and
dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>In a way that evening, which was never repeated, proved a new
starting point in his life. He had had his first close contact with
life on a higher social level, and he could not forget it. New
standards had been furnished him, and unconsciously he was applying
them all the time to all sorts of things--his parents included.
Until then he had blindly accepted them and their ways and their
environment as representing the best this world had to offer. Now
the basis had been laid for doubts that gradually developed into
positive criticism.</p>
<p>The immediate result seemed quite irrelevant. He developed a
sudden objection to running errands for his mother, and especially
to doing anything that involved the carrying of bags or bottles or
baskets through the streets. Packages looking as if they might
contain books remained unobjectional. There was a time when being
sent to the grocery store was a privilege and a distinction. Later
it became an opportunity for clandestine meetings with Johan. Even
during his first year at Old Mary he continued to perform such
tasks without any thought of what others might think of them. He
must have heard things, however, and inner resistances must have
developed, which were now brought into sudden appearance by the
inner echoes of Loth's birthday party.</p>
<p>He did not dare to breathe a word about his new state of mind in
his father's presence. And it was long before he gathered courage
to voice it openly before his mother. But he used all the arguments
and evasions and tricks he could muster to escape what had become a
dreaded ordeal. It developed into a test of will and strength
between Keith and his mother--the first of its kind, and the
forerunner of numerous others still more deep-reaching. After a
while the father discovered or learned what was going on, but,
contrary to custom, that was not enough to settle the matter. In
this case, neither argument nor threats had any effect on Keith. He
avoided open conflict with his father for good and sufficient
reason, and he did what could not be escaped, but he did it in a
spirit of passionate rebellion that introduced a new element of
division and strife the home. Both parents seemed instinctively to
interpret the boy's changed attitude as a reflection on themselves,
and they resented it keenly, but to no avail. While pretending to
insist on full obedience as before, they gave way in reality by
making the servant girl do the errands in place of Keith.</p>
<p>"One of these days I suppose we shall not be good enough for you
any longer," said his mother bitterly one day while the contest was
still on.</p>
<p>"Why, mamma," cried Keith, disturbed by the emotional appeal
back of her words, "what has that to do with my not wanting to be
laughed at by other boys?"</p>
<p>"I almost wish I hadn't persuaded your father to send you to the
public school," the mother rejoined.</p>

<br>
<p>The school year was drawing to its close again Dally's tone grew
less bantering. On several occasions he delivered little impromptu
sermons on the seriousness of life and the difficulties of living.
One afternoon about two weeks before commencement he told them to
close their books.</p>
<p>"I want each one of you to tell me what you expect to become in
life, or what kind of a career your parents have chosen for
you."</p>
<p>A stir of excitement swept over the class.</p>
<p>Then Dally went on to explain why he wished to know. The first
three grades were divided into A and B classes, but that had
nothing to do with the teaching, which was the same in both
classes. The fourth and fifth grades, on the other hand, were
divided into a "Latin" and an "English" branch, with quite
different curricula. Boys headed for the various professions ought
to choose the former branch, while the second one led to more
practical pursuits.</p>
<p>"You are going to be an officer, I understand." Dally said,
turning to <i>primus</i>.</p>
<p>"Yes, sir," the young Jew answered with a self-importance that
even Keith could not miss. "My father wants me to try for the
General Staff, and so I have to specialize on mathematics."</p>
<p>"Humph," was Dally's only audible comment as he made a note, but
he looked as if he had tasted something unpleasant.</p>
<p>"And you, Wellander," asked the teacher.</p>
<p>"I am going to be an explorer," replied Keith without moment's
hesitation, and the whole class broke into a roar of laughter with
Dally joining them.</p>
<p>Keith, as usual, blushed a deep crimson, but did not move.</p>
<p>"That's neither a trade nor a profession," said Dally after a
while, still smiling. "I fear you are fuzzy-wuzzying again,
Wellander. What do you mean by an explorer?"</p>
<p>"One who explores rivers and deserts and unknown countries and
such things," said Keith brazenly.</p>
<p>"And you really mean that you are going in for that sort of
thing?"</p>
<p>"I do," Keith insisted, while the whole class watched him in a
hush that might easily turn either into derision or into
approval.</p>
<p>"There isn't much exploring left to be done," Dally mused,
looking intently at the small boy at the other end of the room.
"Most of the globe is mapped already."</p>
<p>"There is a lot left in Africa," Keith retorted eagerly.</p>
<p>"And what does your father say about it," was Dally's next
question.</p>
<p>There was a long pause broken only by some gigglings by the
irrepressibles down at the bottom of the class.</p>
<p>"I have not asked him," Keith admitted at last. "But I am going
to be an explorer just the same."</p>
<p>"In these days that means you have to become a scientist," Dally
remarked in a changed tone. "It is your only chance, and so I
advise you to choose Latin. It is what I think a boy with your head
should take anyhow."</p>
<p>"All right, Sir," assented Keith, flattered by the last part of
Dally's remark and utterly ignorant of what his choice implied.</p>
<p>That evening he told his father that he had been asked whether
he wanted to enter the Latin or the English branch of the fourth
grade, and that he had chosen the former.</p>
<p>"Why," asked his father.</p>
<p>"Because Dally says I ought to," replied Keith.</p>
<p>"Well, he ought to know," said the father.</p>
<p>But when Keith appeared in the schoolyard during one of the
pauses next day, he was met from every side by the cry:</p>
<p>"There's the explorer! There's the explorer!"</p>
<p>The younger boys jeered openly at him. The older ones pretended
to ask him serious questions about his plans. For days he was the
laughing stock of the whole school, and even on his way to and from
school he was pursued by jibes and taunts. Through it all Keith
stuck quietly to his guns, without a sign of retraction or evasion.
And in the end his seriousness conquered. But from that day he was
known to the entire school as "the explorer," and he heard that
term more often than his own name.</p>

<br>
<p>It was the afternoon of the last day before commencement. The
atmosphere in the class was solemn and more than a little
wistful.</p>
<p>"It is our last hour together," said Dally when all were back in
their seats after the pause. "History is on the schedule,
but--schedules are not made for moments like these. Let us just
have a friendly talk."</p>
<p>He did practically all the talking, and he talked to them more
as an older boy, a chum with somewhat wider experience, than as a
teacher and class principal. It made them feel their own importance
rather heavily, but still more it made them conscious of an
irreparable loss. They knew that school would not be the same in
the fall, when Dally no longer was with them. In accordance with
established custom, he would go back to the first grade and start
piloting a new generation up to the point where they had just
arrived.</p>
<p>The class would break up, too. Some would have to stay behind.
One or two had gone as far as they could and would make a premature
transfer from school to life. Others were bound for other schools
or other cities. The rest would split in two and join with the
corresponding parts of the parallel section to form two entirely
new classes. It gave them a foretaste of what it would mean to
graduate into the <i>gymnasium</i>, and from there into the
university. And it filled their hearts with wistful pride.</p>
<p>The last hour was drawing to a close and everybody was talking
at once, when Dally unexpectedly asked them to give him their full
attention once more for few minutes.</p>
<p>"An act of justice remains to be performed," he said. "There is
a boy among you who has not received all that he had justly
deserved. It was withheld from him by me for his own welfare. The
time has now come when he and you should know all about it."</p>
<p>As he paused for a moment, the boys looked around at each other
with something like consternation. Their curiosity was intense. He
spoke with a tensity of feeling they had hardly ever noticed in him
before, and not one of them had an inkling of what he was driving
at.</p>
<p>"It means that some of you have received more than they
deserved," he resumed. "That also should be known--for the good of
all. It is a reflection on no one but myself, however, and I think
you know me well enough by this time to be sure that I have been
moved by no other consideration than the future good of the one
most nearly concerned."</p>
<p>Again he stopped, the class waiting breathlessly for him to go
on. At that moment Keith became aware that the teacher's gaze
rested firmly on him with an expression that sent the blood in a
hot stream to his face.</p>
<p>"Wellander," Dally began again, and in spite of the beating of
his own heart, Keith noticed that the teacher's voice trembled a
little as he spoke. "Will you do me the favour of rising a moment?
You are the boy I have in mind."</p>
<p>Keith rose like an automaton. His eyes clung to the lips of the
teacher, and he seemed to expect from those lips some utterance
that must make his whole future life different. As often happened
in moments of intensified emotion, he became strangely oblivious of
all the little eddies and cross-currents of thoughts and feelings
that made up his ordinary, every-day consciousness of himself.</p>
<p>"For two years I have kept you number two in the class," Dally
said, speaking in an easier tone as if to lighten the strain on
everybody. "You should have been number one. Davidson, whom I
placed above you has at no time been your superior in anything but
self-control. But it was just your--what I have sometimes called
your fuzzy-wuzziness, that made me afraid of placing you where you
rightly belonged, at the head of the class. It is my belief that
you have in you greater gifts than any other boy in this class, but
I am not yet sure of what you will do with them. It was my
eagerness to see you make full use of them that made me poke fun at
you and keep you out of the place that rightfully was yours.
Perhaps I did wrong, but my meaning was right. I shall always watch
you closely, and I hope you will try your best not to disappoint
me. Will you promise that?"</p>
<p>"I will," gasped Keith.</p>
<p>The clock had already struck three. The moment Dally stopped,
the class broke up, but only to gather about Keith--every one of
them except Davidson, who slipped out of the room with a face white
as chalk. Keith caught a glimpse of that face, and a sense of
reckless elation shot through him.</p>
<p>He sped as never before on his way home. It was still impossible
for him to think the matter through. First he must tell his parents
and hear what they had to say about it.</p>
<p>On hearing what had happened, his mother hugged and kissed him,
her face all smiles while big tears dripped down her cheeks. Then
the father came home and was told everything. His mother looked
serious by that time, and Keith noticed a wavering expression in
her voice.</p>
<p>"Your teacher evidently knows you," was the father's first
remark to Keith, but by his tone the boy knew that he was pleased.
Then he hesitated, and after a while he said as if speaking to
himself: "But if Keith really had earned the first place...."</p>
<p>"That's what I have been thinking," the mother broke in with
blazing eyes. "Do you remember what I said about that boy Davidson?
He was the richest boy in the class, and Lector Dahlstr&ouml;m
simply did not dare to put Keith above him. Now he is trying to
make up for it when it's too late."</p>
<p>"Perhaps," said the father thoughtfully. "The sum of it is what
I have always said: the coin that was made for a farthing will
never be a dollar."</p>
<p>"But Keith was not made for a farthing," the mother retorted
sharply and indignantly. "That is the main point of what his
teacher confessed in school this very day."</p>
<p>"Well, if not," said the father wearily, "it is up to him to
prove it."</p>
<p>And Keith, too, all of a sudden felt very, very tired.</p>

<br>
<p>Keith was one of the first to enter the class room on the
morning of Commencement Day. He was still standing near the door
when Davidson appeared and evidently meant to walk past him without
a greeting.</p>
<p>"Say, Davidson," Keith cried impulsively, holding out his hand,
"I don't mind!"</p>
<p>"Well, what do you think I care," the other boy asked icily as
he turned on his heel and walked out of the room again without
taking the proffered hand.</p>
<p>It was the first time that Keith felt the sting of real hatred.
He could never have acted like that--not even toward one who had
wronged him seriously. What galled him most was that he had been
made to look as if he were apologizing. Then a sense of triumph
returned little by little, but it was not very vivid, and what he
missed utterly was the fact that no other situation could have been
quite so hard on Davidson's pride as the one in which Dally had
placed him. A realization of that fact came only years
afterwards.</p>
<p>Then Dally himself arrived, and soon the commencement exercises
were in full progress, Keith feeling quite superior to any
curiosity or excitement. Again he received a prize, and again it
was in the form of money, but a smaller sum not accompanied by any
special encomiums. He walked home very quietly with his parents,
and they had not much to say either.</p>
<p>Had Keith known what an anti-climax was, he would undoubtedly
have used that word to describe the experiences of his second
Commencement Day at Old Mary.</p>

<h2><a name="III_XIII"></a>XIII</h2>
<br>
<p>The summer was spent quietly on the same island where he had
been so happy a year before. Oscar was not there. Other boys took
his place, but no real intimacy sprang up between them and Keith.
They certainly did not talk of love, and what they knew of sex took
Keith back to the days spent around the big rock. He had a good
time on the whole, but more and more a sense of missing something
fretted him, and he could not tell what it was. For emotional
outlet he was wholly dependent on his mother, and though he seemed
as devoted to her as ever, he had queer spells of wishing to get
away from her. The father was more in the background than ever
during the summer. Once in a while he would show up on a weekday
evening very tired, and leave again with the first morning boat.
During the week-end he wanted above all to rest, and Keith was
partly happy and partly unhappy at being left alone.</p>
<p>Once only during that summer did his father appear under
circumstances that impressed themselves on the boy's memory. It was
the day of the annual regatta of the Yacht Club. When the races
were over, the yachts were towed back to the city by a large
steamer, escorted by a whole flotilla of every kind of craft loaded
with sightseers. It was the gala evening of the season. As the
tender twilight of the August night descended on the smooth waters
of the Lake Maelaren, every villa along the shores became brightly
illuminated, while the progress of the fleet was marked by
incessant bursts of fireworks.</p>
<p>The Wellanders had a splendid view from the little platform on
which their cottage stood. Some friends had been invited for the
day, and the father had brought with him from the city a package of
fireworks. But instead of wasting money on sky-rockets or other
expensive pieces, he had concentrated almost wholly on blue and red
lights, which he placed among the trees and over the plateau and
set off in batches, first one colour and then the other. Because
the place was so high up, apart from the rest, and so heavily
wooded, the effect was probably very pretty from the water. Anyhow
a burst of applause was heard from the passing flotilla.</p>
<p>"That's for us," said Keith's father, "and not for those rich
people down by the shore."</p>
<p>As usual when very much pleased, he laughed while speaking so
that it was hard to hear what he said. But Keith heard, and a glow
of pride swelled his chest. It was the crowning climax of a scene
that touched the boy with a sense of joy bordering on pain.
"Beautiful" was a word used repeatedly by the grown-up people about
him. He knew now that beauty was something that turned ordinary
life into a pleasure more keen than could be had out of eating, or
playing, or reading, or getting presents at Christmas even. To this
wonderful thing his father had added a personal triumph in which
the whole family participated. It silenced incipient criticism for
a long time.</p>
<p>Nevertheless there was another side to that self-satisfied
remark of his father, and it also stuck in his memory. Back of the
proud words lay envy and deference, and a suggestion of hopeless
separation. In Keith's mind it became tied up with his memories
from Loth's party, and all of it formed a complex of thought from
which he tried his best to get away--and most of the time
successfully.</p>

<br>
<p>For lack of sufficient accommodations in the over-crowded old
building, one class had to use the assembly hall. To make the many
disadvantages more palatable, this location was presented as an
honour reserved for the class shepherded by the old Rector himself.
Of this "honour" Keith became a participant when the fall term
opened.</p>
<p>There were no desks--only benches without backs. The rest of the
school left with a sense of relief after using them only during the
fifteen minutes of morning prayer. To sit on them hours at a
stretch turned the day into torture before it was half done. The
only way of resting was to bend far forward with humped back, and
no sooner did the Rector discover a boy in that position than he
descended on the sinner:</p>
<p>"Straight in the back, boy! What do you think you are--an old
hag sorting rags?"</p>
<p>No attempt was made to arrange the boys according to merit. On
the first day every one chose a seat to suit himself, and so Keith
found himself number five without knowing how it had happened.
Number four was a boy of his own size and age named George Murray,
who seemed to be as friendless as was Keith.</p>
<p>Instead of one teacher, they had a dozen at least, few of whom
gave instruction in more than a single subject. It smacked of
university and made the boys feel much advanced. The curriculum
showed an imposing array of new subjects--Latin, French, universal
history, physics, chemistry, and so on. Their novelty caught and
carried Keith for a good while.</p>
<p>Latin was still the most important study of all. It was taught
by the Rector himself, who worshipped everything classic with a
religious devotion and who maintained in so many words that a man's
culture was measured by his mastery of the Roman tongue. In the
lower grades it had been spoken of with bated breath. Keith had
looked forward to the first lesson with trembling impatience. He
plunged into the declination of <i>mensa</i> with the fervour of a
convert. He translated the text-book's <i>colomba est timida</i>
with a sense of performing a sacred rite. Days went by before he
dared to admit to himself that his interest was waning,</p>
<p>Even then he went on studying without a thought of rebellion.
The habit of application had become deeply rooted. The pride born
out of his first easy successes still had urged him to master any
subject offered. But there was a change in his manner of studying
as well as in his general attitude toward the school. Until then he
had been an acolyte in sacred precincts. Now he turned gradually
into a time-server doing his duty out of vanity and a desire to
remain a public school pupil. Until then he had never felt that he
had to study. Now fear of the old Rector and of his father entered
more and more as conscious motives.</p>
<p>He missed the kind guidance of Dally. The Rector never became
the soul and guardian of the class in the manner of Dally. The
other teachers came and went without other interest than to insure
a decent showing in their respective subjects. All had favourites
chosen from those pupils who showed most aptitude for mathematics,
natural history or whatever it happened to be. No one was
interested in the class as a whole, and no one cared for its
individual members as human beings in the make. Within a short time
Keith was simply drifting, although neither he nor those appointed
to guide him were aware of it at the time.</p>

<p>Keith took a liking to George Murray from the start. During the
first couple of days he looked at him frequently as if to invite
acquaintance, but the other boy always appeared deeply attentive to
the subject of the hour. During the pauses he withdrew into a
corner as if to forestall possible advances. At the end of the
second day Keith and Murray reached the stairway simultaneously and
started for the street side by side. Murray's pale, aristocratic
and very narrow face with unduly prominent teeth still bore a look
of indifference, but his attitude had lost a little of its previous
stiffness.</p>
<p>"Where do you live," Keith ventured with for him rare
forwardness.</p>
<p>"On the Quay," replied Murray in a voice that neither encouraged
nor discouraged.</p>
<p>"Where," asked Keith eagerly.</p>
<p>"Corner of St. John's Lane."</p>
<p>"That's my corner," cried Keith. "I live in the lane, and we
have the same way home."</p>
<p>"All right," was Murray's only answer, which Keith accepted in
the affirmative.</p>
<p>Little more was said until they reached the top of the hill
above Carl Johan Square, when Keith explained that he always kept
to the left along the shore of Lake Maelaren.</p>
<p>"I always take the other way," rejoined Murray, suiting his
actions to his words.</p>
<p>"All right," said Keith in his turn, going along toward the
saltwater side of the harbour as if it had been the route of his
own choice. They stopped for a moment to watch the sloops in the
fish market loaded almost to the point of foundering with live
fish. Further out a number of large sailing vessels rode at anchor.
Still further away, where the southern shore drew close to the
point of the island with the turreted red fort, a big black steamer
was seen slowly creeping toward its landing place at the Quay. For
a moment Murray studied it intently, shading his eyes in sailor
fashion to see better.</p>
<p>"That's one of our steamers," he said at last.</p>
<p>"Do you mean you own it," gasped Keith incredulously.</p>
<p>"The company does," explained Murray.</p>
<p>"Which company?"</p>
<p>"The one of which my father is managing director."</p>
<p>"Are there many of them," Keith asked to be polite. It sounded
too much like a fairy tale.</p>
<p>"Seven," replied Murray casually. "They are all painted black
and sail on foreign ports."</p>
<p>"Did you ever travel on one," inquired Keith with something like
awe in his voice.</p>
<p>"Yes," said the slim youngster by his side as if it had been the
most natural thing in the world. "Many times, as far as the pilot
station, with papa. And last summer he took me along on a real
journey to England. That's where our family comes from, and we were
gone three whole weeks."</p>
<p>"Were you scared," Keith asked almost in a whisper.</p>
<p>"No." Murray shook his head with quick assurance. "That is, not
much. We had a storm in the North Sea coming back, but papa said it
was nothing to be afraid of, and for a while I was too sick to
care."</p>
<p>"Sick!" Keith echoed. "And were you not awfully scared?"</p>
<p>"No," Murray insisted, looking rather pleased. "Not much."</p>
<p>Keith was too overwhelmed to ask more questions just then. The
rest of the way home was traversed in silence. At the corner of the
lane they parted with a mutual nod. Then Keith bolted up the lane
and up the three nights of stairs. Entering the kitchen
breathlessly, he yelled out with his cap still on his head: "I
walked home with Murray who lives at the corner and whose papa owns
seven ships and who sits next to me in the class."</p>
<p>"Little boys should be civil," suggested Granny with a glance at
the cap. "And they should also remember that equals make the best
playmates, and that all is not gold that glistens."</p>
<p>"Oh, he's my equal," Keith declared triumphantly.</p>
<p>"With plenty to spare," retorted Granny. "But are you his?"</p>
<p>It made Keith walk home alone the next day, and as he shuffled
along listlessly, the almost obliterated memory of Harald came back
to him.</p>
<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 35%;">
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="III_XVI"></a>XVI</h2>
<br>
<p>The attraction had been established, however--on one side at
least--and it would not let itself be smothered. Nor did Keith make
any strong effort in that direction. It was not his way. He found
it as hard to abstain from what gave him pleasure for the moment as
to bear whatever seemed unpleasant or painful.</p>
<p>Murray made no approaches of any kind, but he did not resist.
His acceptance of Keith's friendship was purely passive, and there
was always a limit to it. At first they simply walked home together
from school. Of course, they sat side by side during the lessons,
but Murray gave his whole attention to the teacher or to his book.
If Keith tried to whisper to him, Murray merely frowned at him.
During the pauses they were often together, chatting or playing,
but it could also happen that Murray chose to mix with some group
of fellow pupils in such a manner that Keith could not get near to
him. Sometimes Keith would then also join them. More often he would
hover on the outskirts in a state of utter misery.</p>
<p>Even when the school closed for the day, it depended entirely on
Keith if they were to have company home. Murray never waited. If
Keith was not in sight when he reached the street, he went right
on. Several times Keith had to run several blocks to overtake his
friend.</p>
<p>"Why couldn't you wait a minute for me," he asked when he had
recovered his breath after one of those pursuits.</p>
<p>"Oh, that's so silly," was Murray's only reply, and a repetition
of the question on two or three subsequent occasions brought no
more satisfactory response. Keith did not press the matter beyond
that point and uttered no protest at Murray's real or assumed
indifference.</p>
<p>Until then Keith had always taken East Long Street on his way to
school in the morning. Now he turned invariably down the lane to
the Quay. On reaching the corner, he took a long look at the corner
house where Murray lived. Two mornings he saw no one and walked on.
The third morning Murray happened to appear just as Keith reached
the corner. After that Keith waited for his friend, and they walked
together to as well as from school. Having waited very long one
morning and fearing that his friend had passed already, Keith
ventured into the house, when he caught sight of Murray coming out
of a door reached by a little spur of the main stairway.</p>
<p>"Is that where you live," asked Keith.</p>
<p>"That's the kitchen door," said Murray. "Our main entrance is in
front on the landing above. It's quicker for me to get out this way
in the morning, and I don't have to disturb anybody."</p>
<p>A few mornings later, Murray was late again, and Keith after
long hesitation walked up to the kitchen door and knocked. A
pleasant-faced serving girl opened.</p>
<p>"Oh, you are the little fellow who waits for George every
morning," she said with a smile. "Come in and wait here. He'll be
ready in a moment."</p>
<p>After that Keith went straight up to the kitchen every morning.
It was a room as large as a hall, shiningly clean, and well
furnished as a dining and living-room for the three women serving
there. Keith became quite familiar with it, but he always remained
by the door, and he always felt that he ought not to be there. Yet
he could no more resist going there than he could stop breathing,
it seemed.</p>
<p>That kitchen was the only part of Murray's home he ever saw. He
never caught a glimpse even of his friend's mother, who evidently
was a very exclusive lady. Two or three times he saw Murray on the
street after school hours in company with a tall, portly and
handsome gentleman, whom he took to be the father. Later his guess
was confirmed, but Murray never showed any inclination to let his
parents become aware of Keith's existence.</p>
<p>For a long while this did not matter to Keith. In fact, he was
not aware of anything but his own devotion. Murray's willingness to
accept it only when nothing else was in sight did not bother him.
He had found some one to worship at last, and he gave himself to
that feeling with an abandon that knew of no reserves and that
asked no questions. He looked up to the other boy as, in ages long
gone by, a faithful vassal used to look up to his liege lord. And
it seemed only meet that such a superior being as Murray should
bestow or withhold his favour in accordance with his own sweet
pleasure.</p>

<br>
<p>Keith had just parted from his chum at the corner of the lane
one afternoon, when he caught sight of Johan near the big back door
of the house opposite the one where Murray lived.</p>
<p>"What are you doing," he said without much enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Johan beckoned mysteriously and would not say a word until he
had got Keith into the shadow of the huge gateway leading to the
paved yard in the rear of the house.</p>
<p>"Can't you come on," he cried impatiently at last "I don't want
mumsey to see me."</p>
<p>When both were hidden from the kitchen window through which Fru
Gustafsson used to keep a religiously preoccupied eye on the doings
of her son, Johan pulled a cigarette from within his coat sleeve
and a match from his pocket. Then he scratched the match on the
seat of his pants and lit the cigarette with the air of a man who
knows what is bliss. Keith watched him with feelings too confused
for expression.</p>
<p>"What would your mamma say if she saw you," he asked at last,
instinctively dropping his voice to a whisper.</p>
<p>"She'd tell popsey," Johan rejoined promptly, "and I'd get
another licking. But it's worth it."</p>
<p>There was a long pause during which Keith watched his old
playmate's unmistakable enjoyment with a mixture of consternation
and admiration, of envy and resentment.</p>
<p>"I have got another," said Johan after a while. "Try it."</p>
<p>Keith shook his head. He was on the verge of saying that "mamma
won't let me," but checked himself in time as he recalled the
results of an earlier use of that too truthful explanation.</p>
<p>"Murray wouldn't smoke," he ventured after another pause.</p>
<p>"Him up there, you mean," inquired Johan with a gesture of his
thumb toward the house across the lane, Of course, he wouldn't.
He's a miss."</p>
<p>"He is not," Keith cried passionately.</p>
<p>"And he's a stiff, too," Johan went on without any particular
display of feeling. "And you're a fool, that's all."</p>
<p>There was a coolness between them.</p>
<p>"I think mamma is waiting for me," remarked Keith as he started
to walk off.</p>
<p>"Of course she is waiting for her baby," Johan retorted with a
leer.</p>
<p>Keith stopped and thought. Murray would fight for a thing like
that, he said to himself. Or would he? Without having reached a
decision Keith made for his own house, trying to look as if Johan
didn't exist.</p>
<p>"He has no real use for you, and you'll find it out," was
Johan's parting shot.</p>
<p>Keith was suddenly struck with the coarseness of Johan's manners
and speech. He was making comparisons in his mind, and as a result
the image of Murray seemed more resplendent than ever.</p>
<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 35%;">
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="III_XVIII"></a>XVIII</h2>
<br>
<p>"Did you ever try to smoke," he asked Murray next morning.</p>
<p>"No," was the disdainful reply. "I know papa wouldn't like it,
and it's nasty anyhow."</p>
<p>"How do you know," wondered Keith.</p>
<p>"Because I know," rejoined Murray. It was a way he had, and it
always settled the matter. A cold, tired look would appear on his
face if Keith tried to press a subject after such an answer, and
before that look Keith quailed.</p>
<p>His state was hopeless. He accepted as law whatever his friend
said or did. And although their friendship, such as it was, lasted
only two years, Keith did not take up smoking until he was in camp
as a conscript at the age of twenty.</p>
<p>In school it was the same. And the fact that Murray attended to
his studies with scrupulous exactness was probably one of the
factors that helped Keith through the grade without any loss of
standing as a scholar.</p>
<p>Like Loth, Murray had mildly artistic leanings, and because he
liked to draw and to sing, Keith, too, had to join in those
studies, although both were elective, and although the singing
classes twice a week consumed one of the two precious lunch hours
that otherwise could be used so profitably for play or study. Keith
had neither aptitude nor interest for draftsmanship, being
curiously set toward the written word. He would have liked to sing
well, as he had noticed that boys having a good voice were always
popular and received a lot of flattering attention. But his ear was
so poor that for a while it looked as if he would not even be
admitted to the singing practices. His persistence prevailed in the
end, and when he and Murray stood side by side, using the same
song-book while practicing some brave old student song, he felt as
much happiness as ever fell to his share in those days.</p>
<p>They had common hours in gymnastics, too, but they were
compulsory three times a week, and Murray took them as a duty
rather than a pleasure. Keith them on the whole, and unlike most of
the other boys, he preferred the slow routine of the setting-up
exercises to the more athletic features. While he never consciously
realized the cause of that preference at the time, it would not
have been difficult for a fairly intelligent observer to discover
it.</p>
<p>Keith was still one of the smallest boys in the school utterly
lacking any physical superiority, although he was in excellent
health and never had experienced a single one of the ailments that
commonly dodge the steps of childhood. He could not shine in
jumping or leaping or climbing, but in the drill his painstaking
attention placed him on a par with everybody else. It was his one
chance of feeling himself the physical equal of his schoolmates,
and it was the only field of common endeavour outside the lessons
where he was not made to feel his own inferiority.</p>

<h2><a name="III_XIX"></a>XIX</h2>
<br>
<p>The insufficiency of one room as a living place for three
persons had long been evident. Keith was in his twelfth year, and
he still slept on the chaiselongue opposite his father's and
mother's bed. He had ceased to pretend that the corner between the
window and his mother's bureau could possibly be considered a
satisfactory "play-room." Then a tenant who had lived with them
quite a while left, and the parlour became unexpectedly vacant.
Keith revelled in the free use of it, and his mother talked
seriously of not renting it again, but the father insisted that
they could not afford to keep it for themselves.</p>
<p>Then Keith's mother had a bright idea. She inserted an
advertisement offering a home and "as good as parental care" to a
boy from the country for the school season. An answer was received,
negotiations progressed favourably, and soon Albert Mendelius, the
son of a minister, was installed in the parlour with understanding
that his use of it was exclusive only at night. In the daytime it
was common ground for both boys, and Keith did his studying in
there, but he continued to sleep on the chaiselongue.</p>
<p>The boys got on very well together, and yet no real friendship
sprang up between them. Albert, who attended a different school,
had his own associates, and Keith could not take much of his mind
off Murray. It made a great improvement in Keith's living
conditions, however, and he hoped it would last.</p>
<p>When Albert went home to celebrate Christmas, Keith was asked to
pay him a visit after the holidays. This invitation became still
more attractive when Keith received a fine pair of skates for a
Christmas present. He had never seen the country in winter, and the
impression it made on him was a little startling. The sight of the
dark pines against the white carpet of the snow filled him with a
mystic longing so strong that it almost frightened him. When he and
Albert put on their skates and stretched out at full speed across
the lake that spread its floor of dark glass within a stone's throw
of the vicarage, he had a sense of never having lived before. The
spaciousness of the house and the pleasant evenings spent cracking
nuts and eating apples in front of the blazing fire-place were also
revelations that filled his mind with many new thoughts. Why was
his own home not like this?</p>
<p>The boys went back to Stockholm together, but before they
started, Keith learned that Albert was going elsewhere to live. An
aunt of his had offered to take him in for the rest of the
season.</p>
<p>"And, of course," said Albert's mother apologetically, "when you
can be with your own kin, it is better you know."</p>
<p>Keith wondered a little. On his return home, his mother said
indignantly that she supposed their humble home had not been found
good enough. A few weeks later the parlour was rented in the old
way to a gentle-looking young man with very pink cheeks who coughed
a good deal.</p>
<p>And Keith once more found himself restricted to the living-room
for all the time spent at home.</p>
<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 35%;">
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="III_XX"></a>XX</h2>
<br>
<p>Keith had been home for lunch and was on the way back to the
school. He was alone. Murray was in bed with some slight
ailment.</p>
<p>It was in January, a cold but brilliant day. The streets were
covered with deep snow. Everything that usually moved on wheels was
now on runners. As runners make no noise and the sound of the hoofs
was deadened by the snow, every horse carried a bell, and some of
them had a whole little chime. The bright sunlight on the white
snow and the tinkling of all those bells made a stimulating
combination, and people hurried along with smiling faces, although
they had to rub their noses and cheeks frequently to keep them from
freezing.</p>
<p>Keith was never sensitive about his face, but his hands were
buried deeply in his coat pockets. His schoolbooks were tied up in
a leather thong and slung over his shoulder like a knapsack.</p>
<p>At the Sluice he stopped and looked long at the people skating
merrily on the rinks down on the ice of the lake between the Corn
Harbour and the railway bridge. A number of boys near his own age
were among the rest having a good time. Many of the boys brought
their skates to school and never went home for lunch, but just ate
a couple of sandwiches in order to spend as much as possible of the
noonday pause on the ice. Keith had asked permission to do the
same, but the refusal had been peremptory. The fact was that he was
granted little or no chance to use his new skates. Once in a while
he got leave, after begging long and hard, to run over to the rinks
at the New Bridge Harbour, in the North End, for a brief while in
the late afternoon. Most of the time even that scant leave was
denied him. To his mother's general disinclination to let him out
of sight was added her dread that he might fall into the water and
get drowned. He promised by everything sacred that he would not
leave the rink, which she ought to know was perfectly safe, but her
morbid fears would not listen to reason. More and more he was
beginning to give up asking even. The disappointment of a refusal
was too bitter to be borne often.</p>
<p>As he stood leaning against the bridge railings, his eyes
strayed farther and farther along the surface of the lake, which
lay frozen as far out as he could see. There were rinks on the
other side of the railway bridge, too, and here and there he
noticed isolated black figures gliding along the unswept spaces
outside the rinks. Suddenly he caught sight of a large gathering of
people very far out. They were moving slowly toward the shore, and
evidently they were held together by some common purpose. He
wondered what they could be doing out there, far beyond the last
rink, but the distance was too great to give him any basis for
speculation.</p>
<p>After a while he had to leave in order not to be late. He had
almost reached the school when he was overtaken by a boy from the
English section of his own grade, about whom he knew nothing but
that his name was Bergman.</p>
<p>"Have you heard," cried Bergman when he was still several steps
behind, although he and Keith had never exchanged a word before.
Keith turned in surprise.</p>
<p>"Three boys were drowned skating during the lunch hours,"
continued Bergman breathlessly. "Two were in my class--Hill and
Samson, you know. The third, Dahlin, was in your own class."</p>
<p>"Is Dahlin dead?" asked Keith blankly. The thing seemed
impossible to him. He had been talking to Dahlin that very
morning--a tall boy, slow, self-possessed, older than most of the
other pupils, and advanced for his age in everything but
studies.</p>
<p>"He is," said Bergman with emphasis. "And so are the other two.
They are dragging for the bodies now."</p>
<p>So that was what I saw those people doing out there, Keith
thought.</p>
<p>"Little Moses was with them," Bergman ran on. "The Jew, you
know. We've always thought him a coward. And he nearly went down,
too, trying to save them."</p>
<p>By that time they were separating at the door to Bergman's
classroom. On entering his own class, Keith found it in a state of
unexampled though subdued excitement. The boys were gathered in
groups which constantly shifted membership. Every one spoke in a
whisper. Reports and rumours of the most fantastic kind passed from
group to group, giving rise to fierce discussions. Six boys had
been drowned instead of three, some one asserted. In another minute
they heard that no one had been lost. Most credence was given to a
circumstantial report of the miraculous recovery of Dahlin after he
had been fully fifteen minutes under water. His big sealskin cap,
they said, had become stuck over his face as he went under, so that
the water could not choke him.</p>
<p>Keith was among the most excited for a while, running eagerly
from group to group and telling what he had heard from Bergman, who
evidently had the very latest news. Soon, however, his mood
changed, and he retired quickly to his own seat. There he sat by
himself, his elbows on his knees and his face resting in his hands.
A stupor had descended on his mind. The whole thing seemed so
incredible. He could not grasp it. Those boys, who had been right
among them only a few hours ago, would never appear again. There
would be a funeral, and then they would never be heard of again.
Tears broke into his eyes. He choked with a vague sense of pity.
Samson, he knew, was the only son of a poor widow. Hill's mother
was very sick, some one had said. And Dahlin....</p>
<p>Keith instinctively raised his head to look at the place which
Dahlin had occupied that very morning. What did it mean ...?</p>
<p>At that moment the Rector entered, long overdue to give them an
hour in Latin--an hour of which a goodly part already was gone. The
boys dropped into their seats. A murmur of expectation passed
through the class. Every eye was on the Rector's face which seemed
to twitch in a peculiar fashion.</p>
<p>"The school has suffered a terrible loss," he said at last, his
voice sounding very hoarse. "There is only one thing we can
do--work! Will <i>primus</i> please begin translating from the top
of the twenty-second page, where we left off yesterday."</p>
<p>The boys stared at him, but no one dared to speak. They knew
there was no escape, and they tried to fix their attention on the
books. Keith saw before him a blurred page full of dancing letters.
<i>Primus</i> stumbled and blundered. He was followed by
<i>secundus</i> and <i>tertius</i>. Keith had recovered a little by
that time, and he knew they were making mistakes that ordinarily
would have called forth a storm of reproof from the Rector. Now he
paid no attention, but merely repeated:</p>
<p>"Go on--go on!"</p>
<p>At last the lesson came to an end, and then they were dismissed
for the day.</p>
<p>On his way home Keith's thoughts ran in a futile circle around
the day's event. If they had never left the rink ... if they had
been saved ... if the story about Dahlin could have been
true....</p>
<p>Always his thoughts returned to the same point: the strangeness
of the fact that those boys would never appear again. At no moment,
however, did it occur to him that the same thing might have
happened to himself--or might happen some time in the future. He
was Keith Wellander, to whom such things never happened.</p>
<p>He was nearly home when he suddenly stopped in the middle of
East Long Street and said to himself:</p>
<p>"Now I suppose I'll <i>never</i> get leave to go skating
again."</p>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="III_XXI"></a>XXI</h2>
<br>
<p>Among other new duties that accompanied Keith's entrance into
the fourth grade was church-going. Until then he had known little
about public worship beyond what he observed during two or three
attendances of Yule Matins, that was almost like going to a party.
The rule of the school was that all pupils in the higher grades who
not going to church with their parents elsewhere must attend
services with their respective classes every other Sunday at the
Church of St. Mary Magdalene.</p>
<p>Judging by the number of boys who turned up, the percentage of
church-goers among the parents must have been very small. Keith's
father went to communion once a year. That was all. The mother went
a little oftener, but as a rule something else turned up about the
time she ought to start, and so she stayed home and read a chapter
in some Lutheran postil instead. Keith thought little of that kind
of books. He had tried them and found them dull beyond
endurance.</p>
<p>"Do you really like reading that stuff," he said to his mother
one Sunday.</p>
<p>"Keith!" she protested sternly. Then she continued more mildly:
"It is not a question of like or dislike, my boy, but of saving
your soul by humbling it before the Lord."</p>
<p>"Can you do that by reading," asked Keith innocently.</p>
<p>"N-no ... not exactly," his mother hesitated. But you can....
Oh, I know I ought to be in church instead of sitting here, but I
am such a weak vessel, and I am sure that the Lord will understand
and forgive me."</p>
<p>"Well, then you don't need to worry, mamma," said Keith
consolingly, stirred as always by the appearance of an emotional
note in her voice.</p>
<p>"We should always worry," she rejoined very gently, "because we
are all sinners and we have a chance only by His mercy. But I don't
believe in a hell, whatever they say, and I don't want you, Keith,
to pay any attention to anything of that kind they may teach
you."</p>
<p>"But why do they teach it then," asked Keith, his logic
alert.</p>
<p>"Because ... it's a long story, and you will understand it some
day. Now I want to finish my chapter, or I won't be able to do so
before dinner is ready."</p>
<p>Keith would have liked to ask more, but what concerned him was
the apparent contradiction in his mother's words rather than the
subject of religion itself. His main impression of religion so far
was that it was something very tedious to which grown-up people
submitted for some mysterious reason never really revealed to
children. And this impression was abundantly confirmed by his
subsequent experiences in the prudishly ugly precincts of St. Mary
Magdalene.</p>
<p>Seats were reserved in one of the side galleries for the pupils
from Old Mary. Two teachers sat in one of the front pews, so that
they could look down into the church. Aspiring youngsters who
wanted to make sure of good marks were apt to look upon the same
pews with special favour. The rest of the boys wanted to sit as far
back as possible, where they could whisper, and show each other
pictures, and eat candy without too much danger of being
discovered. These pursuits brought no relief to Keith, partly
because he possessed neither pictures nor candy, being always very
shy of pocket money, and partly because either fear or some sort of
pride made him draw back from engaging in any sort of mischief
behind the teacher's back.</p>
<p>The hymn singing was not without a certain enjoyment. The
slowness of the tempo made it possible for Keith to keep in tune by
leaning very close to the boy sitting next to him. Even the reading
of the gospels and other recurring features of the service could be
borne. But when the sermon began, Keith fell into sheer agony. The
other boys seemed capable of letting the words of the preacher drop
off them as water drops off the oily feathers of a water-fowl. But
one of Keith's characteristics was that he had to listen to
anything said loudly enough in his presence. For him there was no
escape. Through an endless hour, that sometimes would verge on the
five quarters, he had to sit there and take in every word of a
long-winded, moralistic discourse dealing in forbidding terms with
things that left his brain as untouched as if they had been uttered
in a strange tongue. He had a sense of warnings and threats that
seemed to connect with what his mother had asked him not to heed.
He was told to believe, but he could not make out what it was he
should believe--unless it was the Small Catechism, and that had
always left his mind a perfect blank although he knew it by heart
from the first page to the last.</p>
<p>When at last the ordeal was over, he rushed away with a sense of
relief that was marred by the thought of the same thing happening
two weeks later. It was the only feature of his schooling that left
behind an actual sense of grievance which the passing years could
not mollify.</p>

<p>A little before commencement the whole school was stirred by
important news. A reorganization of the entire school system was in
progress, and one result of it was the merger of the old
<i>gymnasium</i> or high school on Knight's Island with Old Mary
and the expansion of the latter to nine grades under the new name
of St. Mary's Higher Latin School. A building across the street had
already been acquired for the four new grades, and a new rector of
higher rank was to take charge in the fall.</p>
<p>"It means that we'll stay right here until we go to the
university," one of Keith's classmates explained in a tone implying
that it must make quite a difference to their lives. Then he asked
suddenly: "You'll go on to the university, Wellander, won't
you--you with your brilliant mind?"</p>
<p>Keith looked at him in dumb astonishment. In spite of his two
prizes, it was so strange to be called brilliant. And then the
question of going to the university had been raised. Until then he
had really never given a thought to it. And the question of cost
leaped into his mind. He was beginning to learn at last that money
was needed for a number of things you liked to do. Would it cost
much, and could his father afford to pay that much, and, most
important of all, would his father consent to pay it? Those were
novel questions--and as he did so often when faced by something
unpleasant or disturbing, so, now again, he pushed them aside, fled
from them, refused to have anything to do with them. There were
still five grades between him and that threateningly attractive
possibility, the student's white cap.</p>
<p>"I don't know," he said at last, being a truthful fool in most
matters, "I have not asked papa yet."</p>
<p>And there was a smile on the other boy's face which Keith
disliked without guessing the significance of it.</p>
<p>Commencement brought him a prize again--a German dictionary just
like the one Krass got when Keith carried off the highest prize in
school after thinking himself ignominiously passed by. Of course, a
prize was a prize, but--and he thought his father looked rather
disappointed when he heard of it.</p>
<p>However, George Murray also received a book, and It was no
better than Keith's, although Murray professed to see a great
difference between a German Dictionary and a Latin Classic.</p>

<br>
<p>Murray was going off with his family to their private summer
residence in the archipelago outside of Stockholm and Keith
gathered that it must be a very magnificent place. The Wellanders
didn't go to the country at all. Keith's mother had a very bad
period again, full of worry and depression. The summer dragged
along joylessly, and Keith had to fall back on Johan's company in
so far as he could obtain it. But Johan was getting very
independent. He had plenty of other acquaintances, and what Keith
saw of them made him deem it wiser not to mention them at all to
his mother. He was gradually learning discretion of a kind.</p>
<p>He read a good deal, and he was beginning to make unauthorized
visits to his father's bookcase in the parlour. There he had
discovered certain volumes by one Jules Verne, and if he could only
have plunged freely into these, the summer might have proved quite
bearable. One day when he could not get at the books, and his mood
was more than usually fretful, and his mother seemed at her lowest,
she suddenly turned on him and said in a strangely bitter tone:</p>
<p>"All I have to go through now is your fault, Keith."</p>
<p>"Why," he asked dumbly, staring at her.</p>
<p>"Because when you came into the world you hurt me so much that I
have never been well since."</p>
<p>"How," he demanded, and as he spoke an idea flashed through his
mind that his mother might not be knowing what she said. Just how
such a thing could happen was still a mystery to him, but what she
said sounded so absurdly impossible.</p>
<p>At that moment her mood suddenly changed.</p>
<p>"There is one thing I have never told you. But for my being made
so sick when you were born, you would have had a little brother,
and you would not have been so lonesome, and perhaps everything
would have been better. But he was born dead. And now I have no one
but you, and I shall have no one else, and you are everything to
me, and you must love me very much and never leave me."</p>
<p>Her arms were about him, and she was crying. And soon both felt
better. But Keith had heard things he could not forget. And there
was food in them for a summer's thought.</p>

<br>
<p>Form the very start the fifth grade was a disappointment. Once
Keith, like all the rest of the smaller boys, had looked up to it
with awe-stricken yearnings as to a peak that only a few fortunate
few could hope to climb. It was then the top of the school. Its
pupils were revered seniors--olympians tarrying momentarily among
ordinary mortals before they took flight for the exalted regions
where they really belonged. All this had been changed by the
reorganization. The fifth grade now was merely a continuation of
the fourth and a stepping stone to the sixth. And Keith's class was
the first one to miss the honours of which successive generations
had dreamed as far back as the school had existed. It was a thing
no one had considered when the great news was passed around in the
spring. Now it was brought home to those most nearly concerned with
that poignancy of realization of which only youth is capable. It
gave to the whole class a peculiar atmosphere as if it had been
marked in advance for defeat. The teachers seemed to feel it, too,
and especially the old Rector, who, after so many years of supreme
command, suddenly found himself reduced to a subordinate
position.</p>
<p>Keith felt robbed like the rest. And like them, he felt that the
instruction had become a mere humdrum routine enabling a certain
number of boys to get the proper marks at the end of a certain
number of months. What had lured him on as an adventure had turned
into a tedious grind. And more and more he drifted back into a
dream world of his own out of which he had been dragged by Dally's
good-humoured jibes. And yet, what could he expect? Had not Dally
even, his best friend in the whole school, cheated him of the
honour he had rightfully earned--an honour that, once lost, could
never be recovered?</p>
<p>The subjects, on the whole, were the same as in the previous
grade. You simply went further into them--that was all. The
teachers were the same, and the relationships once established
between them and the boys remained the same, for good or bad. Every
one knew what to expect, on both sides, and no one quite escaped
from the resulting sense of staleness.</p>
<p>The old Rector went on cramming the class with Latin grammar. He
had a way of making some poor stumbler conjugate the same verb
fifteen to twenty times in succession, so that the correct sequence
might never again escape his memory. And as the red-faced sinner
stammered out the tenses, the Rector would make a tube of his left
hand into which he poked his right thumb. This gesture was always
accompanied by the same mocking remark:</p>
<p>"That's the way to stuff sausages!"</p>
<p>His language grew more picturesque and unrestrained every day.
He belonged distinctly to an older and less circumspect generation,
and he was a good deal of an eccentric besides. His heart was of
gold, and no one ever took the pedagogue's mission more seriously,
but whatever he possessed of refinement went into his appreciation
of the language that was his life's passion. When he spoke Swedish,
he called a spade a spade in a manner that gave Keith shock after
shock. Always rather given to a certain aristocratic exclusiveness
in his speech, Keith had through his association with Murray become
something of a prude in this respect. He could still descend to
obscenities when his "manliness" had to be proved, but vulgarity
repelled him irresistibly.</p>
<p>Until then he had never dreamt of questioning any authority.
Even at this juncture he obeyed directions explicity and maintained
on the whole his reputation as a good pupil. But a tendency to
criticism was growing within him, and from the men who taught him
it began gradually to pass to the subjects taught. There came a day
when the truth could no longer be evaded: he was bored most of the
time. And the result was that he grew more and more listless.</p>
<p>If asked, Keith could not have told what was wrong. In fact, it
is not at all certain that he would have admitted that anything was
wrong. No rebellious stirrings had yet found tangible form within
him.</p>
<p>He had to learn long lists of foreign kings that had been dead
for ages. He was even expected to know when each king ascended his
throne and left it. He had to learn mathematic formulas and
grammatic rules. And on the heels of each rule hung at least a
dozen exceptions. It was impossible to tell which were of greater
importance, the rules or the exceptions. He had also to learn the
exact number of pistils and stamens possessed by every flower
likely to be found in the vicinity of the Swedish capital. The same
thing happened in every subject embraced by the curriculum. There
was no end to it. Yet he did not rebel. Every one knew that there
was no other way of teaching things, so what was the use of
rebelling?</p>
<p>His memory was good, although tricky. In a case of aroused
interest he could absorb an astonishing number of dates, or
figures, or lines of poetry, at first glance or hearing. But he
could also drop them as if he had never heard of them the moment
his interest was gone. And they always seemed to drop out of sight
when he left school and returned home. That word interest seemed to
give the key to the situation. And all sorts of vague and queer and
inexplicable things within himself determined whether he was to be
interested or not. It was not a question of choice or will. He was
or was not.</p>
<p>Facts as facts did not interest him at all. Even things as
things did not necessarily, though they might. The class made
excursions into the fields and woods framing the capital, and under
the guidance of their teacher of botany they observed and analysed
all sorts of living flowers. Keith was delighted to get out and
charmed with the flowers, but the facts about them pointed out by
the teacher left him profoundly unmoved. They had exciting little
experiments in chemistry, and Keith effervesced with the rest, but
nothing of what he saw brought him more than a momentary
diversion.</p>
<p>All those things left his own real life untouched. And yet he
was not merely looking for fairy tales and adventures. His mind
already was hungry for something else. He found it often in the
books he read at home, many of which had been borrowed from the
school library. Not facts--but how different sorts of facts hung
together, so to speak. The school ought to tell him, and sometimes
he had an uneasy feeling that the teachers were trying to tell him
this very thing. But they failed somehow, and the farther he
advanced, the more exasperating that failure became.</p>
<p>He was in his thirteenth year, and he was no longer certain that
he cared to study. But reading was still his dominant
passion--reading and George Murray.</p>

<h2><a name="IV_II"></a>II</h2>
<br>
<p>Relations with Murray had been resumed on the old basis. Day
after day they walked to and from school together, and hardly ever
was their friendship disturbed by a misunderstanding. In school,
too, they spent a good deal of time in each other's company, and
they continued to sit side by side. Being so much seen together,
they gradually came to be known as "the twins," which pleased Keith
tremendously. But once they had parted for the day at the corner of
the Quay and the lane, there was no more communication between
them. And no matter what Keith said or did, he could never persuade
his friend to break that rule.</p>
<p>Then Murray's birthday came along, and he told Keith quite
casually that his mother had promised to let him have a party and
invite five of his schoolmates.</p>
<p>"Will you ask me," Keith blurted out, his eyes shining with
eagerness.</p>
<p>"I don't know," said Murray guardedly.</p>
<p>"But I am your best friend in school," Keith protested.</p>
<p>"It depends on mamma," Murray explained, and his voice lacked a
little of its customary complacency.</p>
<p>"Of course, I should like to have you," he added after a pause,
but his words carried no conviction.</p>
<p>Keith was too hard hit to say a word.</p>
<p>A couple of days later, on their way home from school, Murray
said unexpectedly that he and his mother had looked over the school
catalogue the night before, and that his mother had picked the five
boys whom he was to invite. And he started to name them. The first
name was that of Brockert, a boy in their own class.</p>
<p>"But I have never seen you speak to him," Keith interrupted
him.</p>
<p>"He is a very fine boy and comes of excellent family," Murray
retorted. Then he enumerated the other four. Only one of them
besides Brockert belonged to their own class.</p>
<p>Little as Keith knew about most of the boys in school, he
realized that all the prospective guests had three things in
common: they were good scholars, poor, and yet of good families.
One had a <i>von</i> in front of his name. Brockert, too, had some
sort of claim to nobility, although it was said that his mother
earned a living for herself and him by working as a seamstress and
the boy was known to pay for his own tuition by tutoring backward
sons of rich families in the lower grades.</p>
<p>Keith tried to look unconcerned. Fortunately they were near
home, and soon he could get away by himself. It has to be admitted
that he cried. And in the end he told his mother, who tried to make
him promise never to speak to Murray again.</p>
<p>"But we're side partners in the class," said Keith, still
sobbing.</p>
<p>There was a certain stiffness between him and Murray during the
next few days, but they kept company to and from school as usual.
Not until the morning after the party did it occur to Keith that
his pride demanded some kind of demonstration.</p>
<p>That morning he meant to keep away from his friend. He stayed at
home longer than usual on purpose. Finally he grew afraid of being
late and tumbled pell-mell downstairs, intent on turning to his old
route by way of East Long Street. But no sooner had he reached the
lane than his legs seemed to be moving regardless of his will, and
they took the familiar turn toward the Quay. At that moment he
caught sight of Murray crossing the mouth of the lane without
looking either right or left. Something like a shiver passed
through Keith's body, but his legs were still in command, and they
began to run. A minute later he was walking beside Murray as he had
done day after day for the better part of three terms.</p>
<p>At first they did not speak. Then Murray began to tell about the
party of the night before as if it had been the most natural thing
in the world to do so. He told what they had eaten and what they
had played and what impression the boys had made on his mother.
Keith listened without a word.</p>
<p>The worst fight he had ever fought with himself was raging
within him, and while he heard every word that Murray uttered, they
seemed to pass him by as if spoken to some other person. His heart
was beating very hard, and he breathed uneasily. An unfamiliar,
impersonal voice within himself was telling him that he must either
give Murray a good licking then and there or run away. Nasty, ugly,
hateful words seemed to crowd to his lips with an all but
irresistible demand for utterance.</p>
<p>Yet he walked on as before, listening to Murray without a word
of comment. At last, when they were near the school entrance, he
stopped suddenly and said:</p>
<p>"Did you ever speak to your mother of me?"</p>
<p>"I did," replied Murray calmly. "And she said that while she had
no objection to our keeping company, she did not think your
father's position was such that we could ask you home."</p>
<p>A strange thing happened to Keith at that moment. It seemed to
him that everything had been satisfactorily explained, and that
there was no reason why he should be angry with Murray or offended
at his friend's parents. He had simply been made to suffer for
something that had nothing to do with his own person.</p>
<p>"Hey, twins," a classmate yelled at them just then.</p>
<p>"I suppose you couldn't help it," Keith said weakly to
Murray.</p>
<p>"I really should have liked to have you," Murray answered, and
it made Keith feel as if he had been more than compensated for his
previous sufferings.</p>
<p>After that their friendship continued outwardly as before, but
there was a difference. A tendency to nag and find fault appeared
on both sides, and on several occasions they broke into actual
quarrels. These always ended in reconcilations, but the old
serenity had gone from their companionship, and each new
misunderstanding left Keith a little more unhappy.</p>
<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 35%;">
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="IV_III"></a>III</h2>
<br>
<p>As a result of the changed relationship between himself and the
friend he idealized, Keith began once more to look up Johan. He did
it rather furtively, as if he had known that he was engaged in
something unworthy of himself. There was an additional reason for
this return to an association long spurned, and it had something to
do with his manner of going about it.</p>
<p>What his mother had told him during the summer was still
fermenting in his mind, but no amount of brooding over it would
produce any results. It was like trying to raise oneself by pulling
at one's own bootstraps. He must turn to some one else for the
information that alone could solve the mystery. Murray was out of
the question. Keith had never exchanged a word with him about the
subject that was taking more and more of his attention. He knew
what Murray would say if such a matter were broached:</p>
<p>"I don't think my papa would like me to talk of it, and it's
rather nasty anyhow."</p>
<p>No, Johan was the person to seek for knowledge of this kind. He
was now smoking all the time when not under the eye of his mother.
While Keith almost had stood still physically, Johan had forged
ahead. There was no denying that he was coarse and dull and
awkward, but there was a shrewd gleam in his somewhat bleary eyes,
and from time to time he threw out dark hints about enjoyments and
experiences that little boys clinging to their mother's skirts
could never master.</p>
<p>It became a sort of game between them--a game that pleased Johan
and drove Keith to exasperation. It was a game of hide-and-seek.
And the most remarkable feature of it was that, although Keith was
dying to know, he found it impossible to ask any direct questions.
His pose was that he didn't care, and Johan's counter-pose was that
he didn't know what Keith was driving at.</p>
<p>Little by little, however, Keith extracted various stories about
those new friends of Johan's, who lived in one of the neighbouring
lanes and who had a big vacant attic at their disposal. There quite
a number of boys gathered daily, and Johan did his best to impress
Keith with the desperate character of their doings. Girls came to
that meeting-place, too. It was the principal thing, according to
Johan--the fact that made those exploits so deliriously
reprehensible. One day Johan was in an unusually communicative
mood.</p>
<p>"Yesterday," he related with great gusto, "Nils got hold of
Ellen and kissed her. And then they crawled into a big empty box
when they thought we didn't see them. And there they stayed ever so
long. But Gustaf crawled up behind the box and peeped. And he saw
what they did, and then he told us."</p>
<p>"What did they do," asked Keith tensely, forgetting his usual
reserve.</p>
<p>"Oh, you know," replied Johan teasingly.</p>
<p>"I don't," said Keith stoutly, realizing that it was a dreadful
admission of inferiority. "And I want you to tell me."</p>
<p>For a moment Johan hesitated. Then he shot at Keith a single
word--a verb--that Keith had heard in the lane and among the
longshoremen on the Quay. He knew that it was bad--the worst one of
its kind. He knew also in a vague sort of way that it touched the
very heart of the mystery he was trying to solve. And yet it left
him just as ignorant as before.</p>
<p>The bald use of that word by Johan stunned him for a moment.
Then his hot thirst for light brushed all other considerations
aside, and he said almost pleadingly: "Can't you tell me all about
it?"</p>
<p>"Oh, everybody knows," said Johan, and his eyes began to wander
shiftily as they always did when he found himself cornered.</p>
<p>"You don't know yourself," Keith taunted him, suddenly grown
wise beyond his ordinary measure.</p>
<p>"Yes, I do," insisted Johan.</p>
<p>"Then tell--or I won't believe you."</p>
<p>"They did what your papa and mamma do nights," Johan shot
back.</p>
<p>There was a long pause.</p>
<p>"They don't do anything," Keith said at last almost in a
whisper, "except talk."</p>
<p>"You bet they do," asserted Johan, sure now of having
triumphed.</p>
<p>And Keith went home without asking any more questions.</p>
<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 35%;">
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="IV_IV"></a>IV</h2>
<br>
<p>A queer restlessness seized him and left him no peace. He swung
abruptly from one extreme mood to another--from mad elation to
paralyzing depression. He had a baffling sense of things happening
within himself that were equally beyond control and explanation. He
grew tired of sitting on those plain benches at school, with no
support for the back, and still more tired of the Rector's
incessant "sit up straight, boy." Sometimes when he read at home,
he could not keep his eyes fixed on the book because his thoughts
insisted on straying into all sorts of irrelevant fields. But no
matter in what direction they started, circuitously they always
found their way into the field of main preoccupation.</p>
<p>Although shocked at the time by what Johan had told him, it did
not remain actively in his memory. On a few occasions he woke up
during the night with an impression of having heard his mother call
his father's name. When he raised his head from the pillow to
listen, a breathless stillness prevailed in the room. Soon he went
back to sleep, and afterwards he thought no more about it. Yet the
very act of listening seemed to inflame his mind in some way.</p>
<p>The game learned back of the big rock had never become quite
forgotten. Yet it had never meant very much to him, and during his
association with Murray he had thought less and less of it. Now it
took new hold of him, in a much more imperative way, as if it had
got a new meaning and a new lure. And it seemed to have some
elusive but highly significant connection with the mystery that
always puzzled and fretted his curiosity.</p>
<p>Once more he pressed Johan for an explanation of that reference
to Keith's parents.</p>
<p>"That's the way children are made," Johan finally announced with
a mien of having transmitted the ultimate wisdom of the ages.</p>
<p>Keith merely stared at him. That answer did not interest him at
all. Of course, he had long guessed that the arrival of children
was a part of the mystery, but it was a part that had ceased to
concern him. What he wished to know, must know, related to himself
exclusively. But in this respect there was nothing more to be had
out of Johan.</p>
<p>At school he began to join a group of boys who always gathered
in a corner of the assembly hall during the pauses instead of
mixing with the mob in the schoolyard. The centre of that group was
Swensson, a handsome young chap of more advanced age than the
others who had spent two years in most of the grades. He was always
behind in his studies, but he seemed to know more of life than all
the rest put together. A large part of the time he was telling
stories--always about girls--or relating adventures--always with
girls. Keith found the stories amusing, but as a rule he failed to
grasp their point. And yet they added fuel to the flame that was
burning more and more hotly within him.</p>
<p>His mother had been watching him intently for some time, and
after a while she began to ask questions. These were guarded almost
to unintelligibility, and yet Keith guessed that they referred to
his own secret--the game learned back of the big rock. And so that
game grew still more enticing. Even then, however, it did not seem
to matter very much except in so far as it was the one thing that
brought him a slight relief from the consuming restlessness of body
and mind.</p>
<p>His mother's questions were followed by long talks, sometimes
taking the form of warnings, but more often turning into passionate
pleas. And gradually he gathered that the game he had been playing
so innocently must be both sinful and dangerous. He tried as hard
as he could to get to the root of his mother's hints, and he wanted
to ask all sorts of questions. But in the end the meaning of her
words seemed to dissolve into mist, and when he tried to question
her directly, it was as if a solid wall had suddenly risen between
them, so that neither one could hear what the other one said.</p>
<p>His father, too, began to ask questions, evidently urged on by
the mother. He spoke sternly, but not unkindly, when he asked if
Keith had been doing anything he ought not to do. And naturally
enough Keith answered emphatically no.</p>
<p>In this way the mystery came closer and closer to him, and
became more and more urgent. His mother's futile efforts at
communicating what apparently rested heavily on her heart made him
ill at ease, but he remained unconscious of any guilt or fear. A
conflict of serious aspect and proportions was undoubtedly taking
shape within him, but so far it was mainly concerned with the
school and his friendship for Murray and a general sense of
dissatisfaction with the life he was leading. It was above all a
sense of things missed.</p>
<p>Then he happened one afternoon, when his mother was out, to be
delving with more than customary audacity among the books in his
father's book case, which become more accessible through the death
of their gentle-looking tenant a short while before.</p>
<br>

<br>
<p>The cough of Herr Stangenberg had been growing worse and worse
all through the winter. He had to take to the bed more and more
frequently. There had been a terrible change in his appearance.
Only the eyes and his temper remained the same. He was always
cheerful and hopeful. So he remained when he had to stay in bed
entirely and a doctor began to pay him daily visits. Keith's mother
did everything in her power to be of help, and it seemed to put her
own troubles and worries more in the background.</p>
<p>"Consumption" was a word the parents often used in discussing
the case of poor Herr Stangenberg, and Keith gathered that it was
something dreadful and merciless, from which escape was impossible.
His attitude toward the whole matter was peculiar. He listened to
what his parents talked, but always in a spirit of utter
indifference, as if what they said could have no possible bearing
on his own life.</p>
<p>One evening the servant girl--her name was Hilda at the
time--brought word that Herr Stangenberg wanted very badly to see
Fru Wellander for a few minutes.</p>
<p>"I think he knows at last that the end is near," Keith's mother
said as she rose to go into the parlour. "What am I going to say if
he asks me?"</p>
<p>"Nothing," replied the father quietly. "Leave that to the
doctor."</p>
<p>On her return, the mother sank down in her chair and began to
grope for a handkerchief. Keith saw that her eyes were lustrous
with tears.</p>
<p>"What did he want?" asked the father with unusual anxiety.</p>
<p>"Well, if you tried for a month, you couldn't guess it," the
mother said, and as she spoke, a smile broke through her tears. "It
is so sad and so funny that.... He wants me to send for his tailor
to measure him for a new spring suit."</p>
<p>"Has he no idea ...?" The father checked himself with a glance
at Keith.</p>
<p>"I know what you mean," said Keith calmly. Both parents looked
at him in surprise, but neither comment nor rebuke ensued.</p>
<p>"No," the mother went on after a while, "he says that he knows
he will be well and back at his office in two weeks. He actually
laughed when I tried to say something about his being very ill. It
brought on his cough again, and for a moment I thought he would die
then and there. But when the attack was over, he asked me if I
couldn't hear that the cough was much better. What do you think I
ought to do?"</p>
<p>"Nothing," the father replied once more.</p>
<p>Keith was ready to start for school next morning when he heard
Hilda utter a startled cry in the parlour.</p>
<p>"Fru Wellander! Fru Wellander!" she called.</p>
<p>Before the mother had a chance to move, the frightened face of
the girl appeared in the parlour door, and she whispered as if
afraid of waking some one out of sleep:</p>
<p>"He is dead."</p>
<p>Both women hurried into the parlour. Keith stood irresolute for
a moment. Then he made for the kitchen door and ran downstairs at
top speed. He was afraid of missing Murray.</p>
<p>All during that day a thought would bother his brain like a
buzzing fly: how peculiar that a man could want to order a new suit
of clothes a few hours before he died. There was something
irrational about it that stumped him. For a moment he thought of
speaking to Murray about it, but it was as if some one had put a
hand firmly over his mouth every time he tried to do so.</p>
<p>The funeral took place in a couple of days. A distant relative
had turned up, very apologetic and eager to explain that his dead
cousin had failed to let any one know that he was sick even. This
young man, the minister, and Keith's parents were the only
mourners. A single carriage sufficed.</p>
<p>Keith never went into the parlour during those days. When
everything was nearly ready, the mother asked him if he cared to go
in and have a last look at poor Herr Stangenberg before the lid was
put on the coffin. Keith merely shook his head.</p>
<p>"You had better go," Granny called from the kitchen. "I never
saw him better-looking while he was alive."</p>
<p>"I won't," Keith yelled back with an amount of irritation that
seemed quite out of proportion to its cause. The mother gave him an
uneasy glance but left the room without saying anything at the
time.</p>
<p>As far as the boy was concerned, the incident was closed. He had
never permitted it to take a real hold of his mind, and he resented
anybody's attempt to bring it closer to him. Death had stopped
within his own threshold, and he simply looked in the opposite
direction. This attitude sprang mainly from some inner resistance
so stubborn that it would not even permit itself to be discussed.
In addition, his mind was engrossed with other things, and the
principal significance it attached to the passing of a human life
at such close quarters was the hope it held out that the parlour
might remain vacant.</p>
<p>"Were you afraid to look," the mother asked Keith on her return
with the father from the cemetery.</p>
<p>"No, I just didn't want to," the boy replied emphatically.</p>
<p>"Why," the mother asked, studying his face with the peculiar
searching glance that sometimes provoked him and sometimes filled
him with a desire to bury his head in her lap and weep.</p>
<p>"Why should I," Keith rejoined. "He was dead!"</p>
<br>
<br>

<h2><a name="IV_VI"></a>VI</h2>
<br>
<p>No sooner had the apologetic young man removed the effects of
his departed relative than Keith wanted to take full possession of
the parlour. His mother checked his eagerness with the explanation
that they might still want to rent it. In the meantime he could use
it freely, but he must remove all his playthings when he was
through for the day.</p>
<p>"Why can't I sleep on the big sofa in there," he asked in a tone
that he vainly tried to make ingratiating.</p>
<p>"Not yet," said his mother evasively. "You had better stay in
here, I think."</p>
<p>Once more the sense of being watched took hold of him
unpleasantly, filling him with a mixture of fear and resentment.
And his wonder why they seemed to suspect him added to the mystery
with which his mind was wrestling so hopelessly.</p>
<p>The constant access to the parlour was a great change for the
better, however, and one of the first uses he made of it was to
investigate his father's little library with a thoroughness that
until then had been out of the question. It was a queer collection,
embracing every form of literature from philosophy to fiction. This
catholicity did not mirror the father's taste but resulted from his
manner of acquiring the books. Before obtaining the position he now
held in the bank, he worked for a while in the office of one of the
principal book printing establishments at Stockholm. There he
formed acquaintances which later enabled him to get one unbound set
of sheets of every book issued from that press. These he sent to a
binder who put them into simple paper covers for a few
<i>&ouml;re</i> per volume. They always arrived in a large package
just before Christmas, and one of the thorns in Keith's flesh was
the care with which his father kept all those new treasures hidden
until the holiday season was past. Then the books that had not been
handed on to friends or relations as Christmas presents were given
a permanent place on the shelves of the book case. All of them,
however, lacked printed covers and illustrations.</p>
<p>The young man whom every one spoke of as "poor dear Herr
Stangenberg" had not been dead a week, when Keith one afternoon on
his return from school found himself alone in the house with
Granny. His mother had gone to call on some friends, and the father
would not come home from the bank for several hours. Even the
servant girl was away, which was a fact that not immaterially
contributed to Keith's sense of security. Granny need not be taken
into account.</p>
<p>A long cherished opportunity had arrived at last, and he made
straight for the book case. It was locked, but he knew where to
find the key. Its hiding-place had constituted one of those little
domestic problems that add zest to an uneventful existence. There
was also an injunction of long standing against any meddling with
the case without permission, but that had been a dead letter for
some time. When books were concerned, Keith's customary respect for
authority ceased to be an obstacle to his desires.</p>
<p>He explored with no special object in mind. He wanted new
reading matter, and his curiosity was piqued by a number of books
with blank backs that gave no clue to their contents. Two huge, fat
volumes on the bottom shelf had already attracted his attention,
and they were the first he pulled out. Their title brought
instantaneous disappointment--"The Philosophy of the Unconscious,"
by Edouard von Hartmann. He prepared scornfully to put them back,
when, through the big gap left by their withdrawal, he became aware
that the space back of the front row was packed with smaller books
and pamphlets. This discovery surprised him for a moment, but what
he saw in there looked rather uninteresting. Nevertheless he
reached in and pulled out a small green pamphlet that happened to
be nearest at hand. Idly he glanced at the legend printed on the
front cover:</p>
<p>"Amor and Hymen. A guide for married and unmarried persons of
both sexes."</p>
<p>The words carried no special meaning to his mind, and in the
same indifferent manner he turned a few pages until his eyes fell
on a full-page illustration.</p>
<p>After that he read no other book for days.</p>
<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 35%;">
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="IV_VII"></a>VII</h2>
<br>
<p>He read as he had never read before in his brief span of
life--as, perhaps, he would never read again, no matter how wide a
stretch of life that span might ultimately encompass.</p>
<p>He read of the anatomical differences between men and women. He
read about the mechanism of love. He read about the mysteries of
procreation. All of it was startlingly new to him, and yet he read
with a sense of always having known it. He read with absolute
acceptance, without a possibility of doubt.</p>
<p>It seemed a genuine revelation that must render all future
questioning futile. And yet he seemed to know no more when he had
finished than he knew before he started. It remained outside of
himself, a structure of air, a series of shadowgraphs, and the
craving within him burned as passionately as ever.</p>
<p>From now on he could grasp the points of the stories told by the
boys at school, and he would know what Johan was hinting at in his
boast about the secret doings of that attic. But of the reality of
the thing he knew as little as before. In fact, the principal
lesson brought home by his reading was that here he found himself
in the presence of something that could not be learned out of
books.</p>
<p>To begin with he did not go beyond the first part of the book.
This he read over and over again. When at last he was sated with
what that part had to give, a subtle chemical change had taken
place in his mental make-up, one might say. It was not caused by
any facts conveyed by the book. These seemed quite natural to him,
and in themselves they would have had no more power over him than
the information about flowers of various kinds imparted by the
teacher of botany. It was the tone used that affected him in a
manner reminding him of the Swedish Punch of which he had tested a
few drops now and then. In every line there was a mixture of
shamefaced apology and veiled desire that sent all the blood in his
body rushing toward his head until the walls of the room about him
reeled. Every inch of him was on fire, and in that flame body and
soul were consumed together.</p>
<p>The sum and substance of it was that he had become conscious of
that multitudinous impulse we call sex, and that from a vague,
restless yearning this impulse suddenly had developed into an
appetite as imperative as any hunger for food.</p>
<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 35%;">
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="IV_VIII"></a>VIII</h2>
<br>
<p>Finally he went on to the remaining chapters of the book, always
with that double sense of knowing it all before and of not quite
grasping what he read.</p>
<p>Pages were consumed before he realized with a shock more intense
than any one previously experienced, that the book was speaking of
the game he learned to play back of the big rock.</p>
<p>Again it was not what the book told that seemed to matter, but
the tone in which it spoke. And while before that tone had sent the
blood to his head, it now drew every drop of it back to his heart
until he shivered and shook with a misery so acute that another
moment's endurance of it seemed unthinkable.</p>
<p>At that instant fear was born within him. Until then it had been
no more real to him than were now the experiences described in the
first part of the book. He had instinctively shrunk from things
that he knew or believed to be painful, from the shock of a blow to
the sting of a harsh word. He had suffered discomforting
anticipation of rebukes and restrictions. But he had never before
stood face to face with that stark unreasoning terror which gathers
its chief power from the intangible character of the danger it
heralds.</p>
<p>He learned that physically and spiritually he had courted death,
and what is worse than death. And suddenly the thought of that
gentle-faced, sweet-tempered young man in the parlour leaped into
his memory. But the image it brought him was not that of a human
form stretched stiffly within the black boards of a coffin. What he
saw and what froze him with horror was the hollow temples and
sallow cheeks and drooping jaws and bent back and trembling limbs
of the human wreck that was still counted a living man.</p>
<p>Worse than that image, however, and worse than any thought of
punishment by powers not within his actual ken, was the book's
damning imputation of shame incurred, of unworthiness proved, of
inferiority so deep that no words could adequately picture it.</p>
<p>All that was most himself wanted to rise in wild rebellion
against conclusions that found no support in anything he had
actually experienced so far. He wanted to refuse belief. He sought
for escapes as if the fulfilment of the doom pronounced by the book
had been a matter of minutes. But there was the book, and to back
it suddenly appeared a line of experiences out of his own life.</p>
<p>Perhaps those who would not let him visit their homes had only
too good cause for refusal. Perhaps, after all, it was not his
father's position but something about himself that had caused the
parents of Harald, of Loth, and now of Murray, to act in exactly
the same way. Perhaps Dally had reasons for not letting him become
<i>primus</i> which, out of his soul's kindness, he never told even
to Keith himself. Perhaps the reason he always felt isolated and
out of touch with his schoolmates lay in their instinctive
recognition of his nature....</p>
<p>In the end he replaced the book with a firm determination never
to look at it again. But the poison was in his mind, and the book
no longer mattered.</p>

<br>
<p>The game learned behind the big rock must never be played
again--that much was certain!</p>
<p>But all resolves proved vain. Fight as he may, the end was
inevitably the same.</p>
<p>Previously he had been the player, and had thought no more of
it. Now he was being played with, and this new form of the game
kept him see-sawing incessantly between ecstasy and agony, between
the relief of yielding and the remorse at having yielded.</p>
<p>His life was an unending conflict, and in the presence of that
ever renewed struggle within, by forces that seemed alien to his
own self, all else lost significance.</p>
<p>And there was not a thing or a person within reach that could
offer an antidote to the self-contempt corroding his soul's
integrity.</p>

<br>
<p>Going to school grew very hard for a while. He could barely look
his schoolmates in the face for fear that they might read in his
eyes what sort of a chap he was. At times, on his walks to or from
school with Murray, a faintness would seize him at the mere thought
that his friend somehow might have guessed the truth. And he sent
timidly envious side-glances at one lucky enough to be raised above
all temptation. For neither his recollections of the gang gathered
about the big rock nor the more recent light shed on such things by
Johan had the slightest influence on his conception of himself as
the sole black sheep in a flock of perhaps soiled but nevertheless
washable white ones.</p>
<p>After a while the poignancy of his emotions became blunted by
familiarity, and mere weariness forced him to accept himself on a
reduced level. A sort of new equilibrium was established within
him, but it was primarily based on indifference. Nothing really
mattered. Effort was useless. Things merely happened. No one could
help what happened. And in this fatalism, so utterly foreign to his
ardent, supersensitive nature, he found a certain momentary sense
of peace.</p>
<p>He went about his daily classroom tasks as in a dream, doing
mechanically what he was asked, and dropping his effort as soon as
the demand for it ceased. Nothing happened during the lessons to
indicate that the teachers noticed any change in him or were in any
manner dissatisfied with him. Perhaps he was saved by an occasional
flaring up of interest that drew from him flashes of that
brightness of mind that had won Dally and given him the reputation
of an exceptional pupil.</p>
<p>But as the spring term drew nearer its close, he found it more
and more difficult to keep up a pretence at attention. More and
more he sank into mere drifting, and he whose pride had been really
to know, now trusted to luck like any dullard with a head unfit for
studying. Worse still and more significant, he began to find
excuses for staying home from school. He who had never known what
it was to be sick, now developed disturbing symptom after
another--headaches and colds and digestive troubles in endless
succession. Most of the time these symptoms yielded quickly at the
mere sight of the castor oil which was his mother's favourite
remedy and the taste of which Keith hated more than anything else
in the world. It was the one thing that stood inexorably between
his growing indolence and the luxury of being ill.</p>
<p>With commencement almost in sight, all sorts of written
examinations were demanded. These he disliked additionally because
his handwriting never had developed in proportion to his mental
capacity. No matter how he strove, the letters remained childishly
awkward. No two of them seemed to point in the same direction. Not
even his futile efforts at singing could fill him with a more
humiliating sense of inferiority.</p>
<p>All his various resistances were brought into concerted action
when at last the teacher in Swedish ordered him to prepare two
brief original compositions on quite simple themes. In the days of
Dally he would have revelled in such a task. Now it appalled him.
His head was empty. The mere idea of trying to write about such
things as the discovery of America and the beauties of nature
seemed silly. There was any number of books, besides, that said
anything you could ever hope to say on either subject.</p>
<p>The end of it was that he produced an indisposition real enough
not only to convince his mother but to make himself willing to face
the ordeal of castor oil. Thanks to the oil he was able to stay in
bed the better part of two days. Those were the last two days
before his Swedish compositions were to be delivered. He knew that
if they were not delivered, he would get no mark in that subject,
and this would prevent his graduation to a higher grade.</p>
<p>In that dilemma he conceived the brilliant idea of making his
mother write the compositions for him, and he actually succeeded in
persuading her to do so. He prompted her a little, but she did the
main part of the work, and the handwriting was hers. Finally he got
her to bring them up to school with the explanation that he was too
sick to sit up and write, but that she had taken down what he
dictated. He did not even look at what she wrote, and it never
occurred to him to doubt her ability of doing it far better than he
could. When it was all over, he experienced a tremendous sense of
relief, and this was much enhanced by his mother's willingness to
let the father remain in complete ignorance of what had
happened.</p>
<p>Nothing was said to him when he showed up at school again. His
first inkling of trouble came with the return of his copy book. It
was full of marks and corrections in red ink. As he looked at these
in a stunned fashion, he realized for the first time that his
mother's spelling and punctuation would have been deemed
unsatisfactory in a second grade pupil. At first he did not even
consider the bearing of this discovery on his own fate. He could
think of only one thing, namely that another blow had been dealt to
his conception of his mother as a superior being. He actually felt
ashamed on her behalf. Then came the thought of what the teacher
must have thought....</p>
<p>Commencement Day brought the answer. He got only C in Swedish,
which meant that he had failed to pass. It gave him the choice
between spending another year in the same grade or facing special
examinations in the fall.</p>
<p>At first he was too dazed to think. Then his former indifference
changed into blazing indignation and resentment. He felt himself a
victim of unpardonable injustice. In that mood he returned home and
reported to his father.</p>
<p>"You talk nonsense, my boy," said his father in a tone that was
new to Keith. "From some things I have heard, I gather that your
escape from the same kind of mark in every subject was little short
of miraculous."</p>
<p>Keith stared open-eyed at his father, puzzled by his manner of
speaking and stung to the quick by what he said.</p>
<p>"What are you going to do now," his father demanded after a
while.</p>
<p>A long pause followed during which Keith's brain worked at
lightning speed. It was as if he had never known until then what
really had happened during the weeks preceding commencement.</p>
<p>"I'll pass the examinations in the fall," he said at last.</p>
<p>"Will you give me your word of honour to read hard during the
summer," his father asked, and his voice set the boy's heart
throbbing like an engine.</p>
<p>"I will," replied Keith. "But I could pass those examinations
without looking at the book."</p>
<p>"The more shame for you, then, to let yourself be plucked," was
his father's concluding remark, but even that was uttered without a
suggestion of bitterness.</p>
<br>

<br>
<p>The summer was spent on the mainland opposite the island where
they used to live. He had practically no companionship except that
of his mother. It was very dull, but for the first time he seemed
to need solitude. He had brought out all his schoolbooks, and he
really did a good deal of studying, especially of Latin, which he
knew was his weakest point.</p>
<p>At first he felt a slight grudge against the mother. She had
disappointed him for one thing, and there was an inclination
besides to hold her responsible for his misfortune. By degrees,
however, he began to see his own part in its true light, and he
wondered how he could have been such a blind fool. It was this
understanding that brought him comparative peace and enabled him to
work. He had been so harassed by the question of guilt in regard to
actions which his own mind would never have classed as wrong that
the sense of facing punishment clearly deserved came as a genuine
relief.</p>
<p>The monotony of the season was only broken by a visit to the
summer home of Aunt Agda at Laurel Grove, where he stayed a whole
week and made a lot of friends. She had served with the Wellanders
as a nurse girl when Keith was only a baby. Then she was plain
Agda, and Keith's mother often spoke of how crazy she had been
about him. Then she disappeared, and when the Wellanders next heard
of her, she was the wife of a well-to-do retired merchant, to whom
she had borne three children while she was merely a servant and his
first wife still lived. Keith had often overheard his parents speak
of Agda's phenomenal rise with ironic smiles, but he didn't care
for anything except her continued inclination to spoil him.</p>
<p>There was a lot of children at Laurel Grove, boys and girls, and
most of them matched Keith in age. They took him in, and in that
one week he had a glimpse of the kind of life he would have liked
to live. There was in particular one boy, Arnold Kruse, for whom
Keith formed a warm attachment. This feeling was additionally
cemented by Arnold's choice of Keith as a confidant. Arnold was in
love with the prettiest girl in the place, Gurlie Norlin, and so
was every other boy within reach of Laurel Grove. But Arnold was
the favourite, and he told Keith that he and Gurlie had agreed to
wait for each other and to marry as soon as they were of age.</p>
<p>It was like a fairy tale to Keith--a wonderful tale like no one
he had ever read. And the most wonderful thing about it was that it
was real, and that he was permitted to play a sort of part in it.
His thoughts went back to Oscar and what he had told Keith about
the love between Oscar's father and mother. Here was love again,
mystically beautiful, so that it brought a new light into the faces
of those it touched. And Keith's heart grew lonely and wistful
within him. But strangely enough, he never thought of connecting
Arnold's love for Gurlie with what he had read in the book found in
his father's book case. That was quite a different thing, he
felt.</p>

<br>
<p>The presiding genius of the examinations was Lector Booklund,
teacher of Latin in Lower and Upper Sixth. He was short and stocky
and gnarled by gout. Instead of speaking, he emitted a series of
verbal explosives, and the boy whose answers didn't come quick
enough became the object of withering scorn. Most of his life
seemed concentrated in his eyes where twinkling merriment and
blazing anger alternated with bewildering rapidity. He posed as a
tyrant, but the boys who knew him well said that at heart he was as
kind as he was just, and that his nervous impatience and bursts of
rage were merely the results of severe physical sufferings.</p>
<p>The moment he caught sight of Keith among the boys up for
examination, most of whom hailed from other schools, he became
interested and began to draw him out. And Keith was able to respond
with some of his old-time quickwittedness. His ambition had been
stirred into a semblance of life through the shock of his failure,
while the summer's rest and peace had brought back some of his
natural vivacity. The inner conflict was still a source of trouble,
but it did not seem quite so much a matter of life and death. He
had not yet passed the crisis, but he had reached a point where a
little tactful nursing might put him on the right path again for
good. What he needed above all was encouragement, and that was what
he got for a while from the new class principal.</p>
<p>He passed the examinations with ease. Then the sense of being a
favoured pupil once more made him throw himself into the studies
with considerable zest. Little by little, however, his zest slacked
off. More and more frequently he became the object of blame or
ridicule instead of praise. By and by Lector Booklund found it hard
to ask him a question or give him a direction without open display
of irritation. It was evident that he felt disappointed in Keith,
and he did not hesitate to show it.</p>
<p>Many causes combined to produce the slump in Keith's aspirations
that in its turn produced the changed attitude of the teacher. The
latter's impatience had probably as much to do with it as anything
else, while his splenetic manners and speech intimidated the boy's
already overwrought sensitiveness. The subjects taught and the form
of the teachings did their share, too. Grammar and rules and dry
data seemed to play a greater part than ever. In Latin, for
instance, they were reading Ovid's "<i>Metamorphoses</i>" and the
colourful old legends might easily have been used to arouse the
boy's interest, if attention had merely been concentrated on the
stories told and the life revealed by them. But the teacher was
first and last a grammarian, and he would wax frantically
enthusiastic over some subtle syntactic distinction which left
Keith peevishly indifferent. And Lector Booklund was positively
jealous on behalf of his own subject, so that once he flung a
bitingly sarcastic remark at the boy because his attention had
flared up at the quoting of a phrase in English.</p>
<p>Keith's progress in English showed that he was still capable of
both interest and effort. This language was quite new to him, and
the class had it only one hour a week. But the man who taught it
had advanced ideas for his day, and instead of boring the boys with
a lot of abstract rules relating to a wholly unknown tongue, he let
them start right in on one of the English prose classics. They were
told to pick out the meaning of the principal words in advance, and
the pronunciation was explained as they took turns at reading
aloud. All the time the teacher kept the principal part of their
attention focused on the story gradually revealed. During that one
hour a week Keith's mind never wandered. But it was the only rift
in the scholastic fog that kept him in a state of constant
boredom.</p>
<p>In the meantime things were happening at home that did not help
the situation.</p>

<p>He had moved into the parlour at last. It was almost his own
room. An old piece of furniture, half wardrobe and half dresser,
standing in the vestibule outside the parlour, had been turned over
to him for good. His library and his playthings were installed on
the shelves in the upper part. His personal things occupied a whole
drawer below. At night he slept on the big sofa, and the door to
his parents' room was closed.</p>
<p>One night he lay awake unusually long. The old struggle was
going on within him, and there was no peace in sight. His parents
had gone to bed a good while ago, and as far as he was concerned
just then, they had practically ceased to exist.</p>
<p>Then his attention was attracted by a slight noise from their
room. The stillness of the night made it audible to him in spite of
the closed door. At first he listened out of idle curiosity, and to
get away from his own feverish thoughts. Finally he got up without
any clear idea of what he was doing, or why he did it. He began to
tremble even as he moved on tip-toe across the room. At the door he
had to kneel down to steady himself.</p>
<p>He could not tell whether an hour or a minute had passed when he
crawled into bed again. His whole body was on fire. He could feel
the pulses at his temples hammering. At that moment he knew what
passion was. The man in him had been let loose, and he wanted to
cry aloud with the bitter-sweet agony of it.</p>
<p>There was no thought of father or mother in his mind. The people
back of the door were just a man and a woman. The feelings that
surged through his heart, shaking his body volcanically, would have
been the same if those two had been perfect strangers.</p>
<p>No jealousy stirred him. No sense of shame shocked him. His
dominant emotion was envy.</p>
<p>The visit of death had left him unmoved. Now he had been as
close to life in its most intense form, and the effect of it was
maddening--a call that seemed to make further waiting worse than
death.</p>
<p>He fell asleep at last with a part of the pillow stuffed into
his mouth to keep his sobs from being heard in the next
room....</p>

<p>The thing had him by the throat. It was stronger than any power
he could bring to bear against it. Fighting it was useless.
Resistance meant merely prolonged torture. Surrender meant
sleep--and torture of a different kind the next day.</p>
<p>Once more he managed to get hold of the book that had wrought
such disastrous change in his entire existence. He read again the
chapters bearing directly on his own case. They seemed more
convincing than ever. There could be no doubt of his degradation or
his doom.</p>

<br>
<p>He came running home from some errand one evening not long
before Christmas. His mind was more at ease than it had been for a
long time. That season of the year rarely failed to bring him a
little happiness.</p>
<p>The moment he flung open the kitchen door, he knew that
something was wrong, and his heart sank within him.</p>
<p>The mother stood in the middle of the floor wringing her hands.
Granny sat on the sofa, stolid-faced as usual, and rolled one of
her endless bandages. On the chair by the window sat the father,
his shoulder against the wall, his left elbow on the table, and his
head resting in his left hand.</p>
<p>Keith could hardly believe what he saw.</p>
<p>His father's face was contorted with pain or grief. Big tears
rolled down his cheeks and dropped on the table before him. Every
little while he was shaken by a sob that almost choked him.</p>
<p>"Is he sick," the boy gasped.</p>
<p>"Something dreadful has happened," the mother stammered, unable
to take her eyes off her husband.</p>
<p>"You had better go into the parlour, Keith," whispered Granny as
she started on a new roll.</p>
<p>Keith turned his glance once more to the father. He had never
seen a man cry before, and until that moment such a lack of control
on the part of his father had seemed quite unimaginable. The
strangeness of it frightened him.</p>
<p>"I fear it will kill him," he heard his mother mutter.</p>
<p>"I wish it would," the father broke out, raising his head for a
moment. "But it won't, Anna.... I'll be over it in a minute."</p>
<p>His words were forced out between sobs. Keith saw that he was
struggling terribly to get himself in hand.</p>
<p>Then he caught sight of Keith, whose entrance he evidently had
not noticed, and as usual the presence of the boy brought back the
self-restraint for which he had been striving vainly until
then.</p>
<p>"Keith," he said, speaking much more quietly, "your Uncle
Wilhelm has been arrested for using money that didn't belong to
him. I can't believe it, but I am sure they will send him to
jail.... You must always remember what I have told you about
money...."</p>
<p>His own words seemed to bring back to him the full horror of the
situation, and he threw himself face downward over the table in
another convulsive outburst of grief.</p>
<p>Granny on the sofa was signalling frantically to Keith to leave
the room. Mechanically he obeyed her. Anything was better than to
watch his father....</p>
<br>

<br>
<p>Little by little he learned the whole sad story. At the same
time he realized that Christmas would probably be spoiled--the one
thing he had banked on for momentary relief.</p>
<p>Once upon a time Uncle Wilhelm had been the most prosperous
member of the family, owning a big, fine grocery store in the
fashionable North End district. He made a lot of money, but his
wife was vain and foolish and pleasure-loving. She always managed
to spend more than he could ever earn, and he was idiotically in
love with her. It ended in bankruptcy. Uncle Wilhelm got a position
as superintendent of a small factory in the South End. There he
might have done very well in a more modest way, had not his wife
proceeded to turn his life into a perfect hell. This was her way of
punishing him for his failure to support her in the style she
demanded. He was weak in more ways than one, and soon he drank not
merely for the sake of a good time, as everybody else did, but to
find consolation and forgetfulness. His private affairs went from
bad to worse. Gradually he lost the habit of distinguishing between
his own meagre funds and those entrusted to him. It was a clear
case, and his employer proved merciless when it was found out.</p>
<p>What Keith's father had feared came true. And that Christmas was
more sad than any other part of any other year had ever been.</p>
<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 35%;">
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="IV_XVII"></a>XVII</h2>
<br>
<p>It would have been hard on Keith at any time. Coming as it did,
the family disgrace, which he guessed rather than grasped, and the
disappointment, which was a depressingly tangible thing, brought
his natural sensitiveness to a morbid pitch.</p>
<p>There was one idea that haunted him day and night--the idea that
he belonged to a race doomed in advance to decay and
destruction.</p>
<p>Uncle Wilhelm's case was not an isolated one. There was Uncle
Henrik, the youngest brother of Keith's father, who had gone to the
dogs while still a youth, and in a more ignominious fashion, if
possible. What was he now but a besotted tramp, begging shamelessly
of friend or stranger for a few <i>&ouml;re</i> with which to buy a
brief moment of coarse happiness?</p>
<p>There was Uncle Marcus, the husband of Keith's paternal aunt,
who had hurt his leg in a storm and lost his splendid position as
chief engineer of the swiftest steamer plying on the Northern
route. Now he was disabled for ever, and proud Aunt Brita was at
her wit's end to keep the home and the family together.</p>
<p>There were the two half-brothers of Uncle Wilhelm's silly
wife--popular and dashing young fellows reading blithely the purple
path to destruction. Even Keith's na&iuml;ve mind had discovered
which way they were headed, although his thoughts of them were not
free from admiration.</p>
<p>And there were still others. Wherever he turned within the
narrowing family circle, he met similar instances of progress in
the wrong direction. Some were sinners and some were victims of
fate--or seemed so--but it came to the same thing in the end.</p>
<p>"The Wellanders are going," Keith's mother said one day to Aunt
Brita when she was too depressed and worried to mind the boy's
presence.</p>
<p>"Yes," replied Aunt Brita grimly, "and so is everybody else who
ever had anything to do with them. Keith will have to start it all
over again from the beginning."</p>
<p>That seemed to settle it for the moment. Of what avail could his
own feeble struggles be in the face of an adverse destiny?</p>
<p>He brooded over it, and out of his brooding came resentment, and
more and more this resentment turned against his relatives in a
fury of disgust. He had a feeling of their having betrayed
him....</p>
<p>Now and then, however, one of the expressions used by Aunt Brita
would recur to him with a suggestion of quite different
possibilities.</p>
<p>"Keith will have to start it all over again from the beginning,"
she had said.</p>
<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 35%;">
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="IV_XVIII"></a>XVIII</h2>
<br>
<p>If he only had some one to talk to.... But he was more lonely
than ever. Murray had moved to another part of the city, more in
keeping with his father's increasing prosperity, and was now
attending a North End school. They had parted with no more ado than
if they had expected to meet the next day again. Now and then Keith
thought of Murray with a touch of sentimental regret, but it was
wearing off.</p>
<p>Johan was still found at the foot of the lane, smoking and
bragging and leering as before. To Keith he had become positively
loathsome.</p>
<p>There was no one else in sight--not one boy in the class out of
whom Keith might hope to make a friend. Leaving other factors
aside, his lack of pocket money was sufficient to keep him apart
from the rest. They all had some sort of allowance, however scant,
and they took turns treating each other to pastry or candy bought
from a couple of old women who brought basketfuls, to the school
doors during every pause. He had to beg especially for every
<i>&ouml;re</i>, he couldn't get much at that.</p>
<p>He wore a suit made over by his mother from clothes given to her
by a woman of some means with whom she had a slight acquaintance.
They had been outgrown by that woman's son, and they had been
offered to Keith's mother because they were too good to be thrown
away. There was nothing about it to be ashamed of, and the
made-over suit was neat enough, though a little awkwardly cut. A
couple of years earlier, Keith would have hailed it with delight.
Now the wearing of it seemed worse than going about naked. He
thought that every one noticed the suit and knew that it was not
really meant for him.</p>
<p>He read contempt in every glance, and by degrees he developed a
temper that was checked only by the humiliating consciousness of
his physical inferiority. After nearly five years in school, he was
still one of the smallest boys in height and bodily development,
and neither gymnastics nor the military drill that became
compulsory in the sixth grade had the slightest effect on him. And,
of course, he suffered the more from it because he ascribed his
lack of stature and muscle to what he had now begun to think of as
his own moral weakness.</p>
<p>A petty quarrel one day brought on another fight with Bauer, and
this time right in the class room. They rolled around on the floor
between the desks and separated only when some one cried out that
Booklund was coming. Keith was thoroughly aware of the fact that
his classmates regarded their behaviour as inexcusably undignified
in pupils of the Lower Sixth, but contrary to custom, he didn't
care very much. What almost made him cry was that the thought that
at the moment of separation Bauer once more was on top of him--just
as when their first fight came to an end five years earlier. And
then Keith was brought still nearer to tears by his disgusted
realization of that infantile tendency to cry in every moment of
unusual strain.</p>
<p>But, of course, how could he expect anything else?</p>
<p>His whole bearing changed gradually. The gay forwardness that
had caused Dally to make fun of him--and like him, perhaps--was
quite gone, but gone, too, was the shyness that always had run side
by side with it. His most frequent mood was one of irritable
rebellion, and in between he would have spells of sulkiness that
estranged the teachers and surprised himself in his more wholesome
moods. He snarled to his mother, and he would have done so to his
father if he had only dared.</p>
<p>The school seemed sheer torture much of the time, and all its
objectionable features seemed to centre in the Latin. His hatred of
that subject approached an obsession. There was no doubt that
Lector Booklund could feel it, and every day he watched Keith with
more undisguised hostility. At last he could not speak to the boy
without losing his temper, and so for days at a time he would not
speak to him at all. At such times Keith's state of mind presented
a riddle hard to solve. He posed to himself and others as
tremendously gratified at being left alone and not having to answer
any bothersome questions. Inwardly, however, he was more hurt and
offended by that neglect than by any other rebuke the teacher could
have devised.</p>
<p>Such a period of suspended communication had lasted more than a
week, when, at the wane of the term, the inevitable explosion
finally occurred.</p>
<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 35%;">
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="IV_XIX"></a>XIX</h2>
<br>
<p>The class had just turned in their copybooks with a Latin
exercise prepared at home. Lector Booklund was standing at his desk
with the whole pile in front of him. Keith's book happened to be on
top. The teacher opened it. He sent a glance at Keith that made the
boy squirm. Then, as his eyes ran down the page, his face turned
almost purple. Suddenly he raised the book over his head and threw
it on the floor with such force that the cover was torn off.</p>
<p>A moment of ominous silence followed. Keith was red up to the
roots of his hair.</p>
<p>"Wellander," the teacher roared.</p>
<p>Keith rose none too quickly from his seat without looking
up.</p>
<p>"Pick up that thing," Lector Booklund shouted at him with the
full force of his powerful lungs. "I don't want to touch it
again."</p>
<p>Keith remained like a statue, feeling now as if he didn't have a
drop of blood left in his whole body.</p>
<p>"Pick it up, I tell you!"</p>
<p>"No," Keith retorted in a strangely self-possessed voice, "you
had better pick it up yourself. I didn't throw it on the
floor."</p>
<p>In another moment the teacher was beside Keith, burying his hand
in the boy's hair. Then he pulled and shook, shook and pulled,
until the hand came away with big tufts of hair showing between the
fingers.</p>
<p>Again absolute silence reigned for a moment.</p>
<p>"Ugh," blew the teacher, his anger changed to a look of
embarrassment. "I am not going to speak another word to you,
Wellander, during the rest of the term. Sit down!"</p>
<p>Instead of sitting down, Keith walked over to the torn copy
book, picked it up and turned toward Lector Booklund.</p>
<p>"I am going home," he announced almost triumphantly. "You have
no right to hit me or pull my hair out by the roots."</p>
<p>Before the teacher had recovered from his surprise Keith was
outside the door and on his way home.</p>
<p>He didn't know afterwards how he got there, but he could
remember saying to himself over and over again:</p>
<p>"I didn't cry and I didn't want to cry!"</p>
<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 35%;">
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="IV_XX"></a>XX</h2>
<br>
<p>He told his mother truthfully what had happened and declared in
conclusion that he would never go back to school again.</p>
<p>She was furious with the teacher and thought that on the whole,
it would be safer for Keith to stay away during the few weeks
remaining of the term.</p>
<p>"That man should be punished," she cried repeatedly. "You did
just right."</p>
<p>But the father spoke in another tone when he, in his turn, had
heard the tale of that eventful day.</p>
<p>"You will go to school tomorrow as usual," he said in his
sternest voice. "You had no right to refuse to pick up the book,
and you had no right to leave the school without permission."</p>
<p>"I can't go back after being treated like that, papa," Keith
remonstrated, trying vainly to make his tone sound firm.</p>
<p>"You will," the father reiterated, "or I'll...."</p>
<p>He stopped and thought for a minute.</p>
<p>"Or you'll begin to learn a trade tomorrow. Take your
choice."</p>
<p>Father and son looked long at each other.</p>
<p>"Carl ..." the mother began pleadingly.</p>
<p>"Please, Anna," the father checked her. "This is too serious.
The boy's future is at stake."</p>
<p>Then he turned to Keith and said more kindly: "I ask you to go
for my sake."</p>
<p>"I will," the boy blurted out with a little catch in his
voice.</p>
<p>His pride was broken, and once more those everlasting tears were
dimming his eyes.</p>
<p>He felt weak and helpless, but through his dejection broke now
and then a sense of pleasant warmth. His father had asked him to go
"for his sake."</p>
<p>Such a thing had never happened before.</p>
<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 35%;">
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="IV_XXI"></a>XXI</h2>
<br>
<p>The class was discreetly preoccupied when Keith showed up as
usual next morning. Only Young Bauer evinced a slight inclination
to taunt him, but was curtly hushed up.</p>
<p>During one of the afternoon hours the door of the classroom
opened unexpectedly and Keith's father appeared on the
threshold.</p>
<p>"Will you pardon me for just one moment, Sir," he said to the
astonished teacher. Then, without coming further into the room, he
addressed himself to Keith: "I have had a talk with the Rector and
with Lector Booklund. I have heard all about your behaviour in
school, and I warn you now that unless you do better, I shall give
you the treatment you deserve. Bear that in mind."</p>
<p>Then he vanished as abruptly as he had appeared.</p>
<p>A couple of the boys snickered. The teacher rapped sharply on
the table with the book he held in his hand.</p>
<p>Keith sat absolutely still with bowed head. He couldn't think.
He didn't dare to think of ever facing one of those other boys
again. And suddenly it occurred to him that his father had looked
quite common, like a workman almost, while he stood there at the
door, talking across the room to Keith.</p>
<p>But a tiny voice somewhere within himself denied it.</p>
<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 35%;">
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="IV_XXII"></a>XXII</h2>
<br>
<p>The term dragged to an end.</p>
<p>Commencement Day was no longer a cause of joyful anticipation.
It had to be borne like many other things. But it did mark the
end.</p>
<p>Keith learned without much heartbreaking that he had got a "C"
not merely in Latin, which he expected, but in behaviour as
well--he who all through his school period had never had less than
"A" on his personal conduct.</p>
<p>Well, it merely clinched the decision he already had formed. One
could not pass any examination in behaviour. And after what had
happened, the thought of going back to the same classroom in the
fall gave him a sensation of outright physical discomfort. Anything
was better than school.</p>
<p>Not even his mother had put in an attendance that day. He had to
walk home by himself, all the other boys being accompanied by
pleased or resigned parents. But it was in keeping with the rest of
what he had to go through.</p>
<p>Out of the midst of the shapeless throng of dark thoughts
filling his head, a quite irrelevant memory pushed to the front as
if in answer to an unspoken question. It consisted of the words
spoken by Aunt Brita:</p>
<p>"Keith will have to start it all over again from the
beginning."</p>
<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 35%;">
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="IV_XXIII"></a>XXIII</h2>
<br>
<p>The first few days after the closing of the school were
wonderfully restful. The parents proved remarkably forbearing.
Neither one spoke a word of reproach. Nothing was said about the
future. It was as if some sort of fear had checked them.</p>
<p>The home seemed unusually quiet and pleasant. There was any
amount of time for reading, and no suggestions were forthcoming as
to what should or should not be read. Yet Keith remained satisfied
only a few days.</p>
<p>No one knows what might have happened if they had gone into the
country for the summer as they used to do. But again the whole
family had to stay in town for some reason not divulged to Keith.
And with the heat and the sunshine came the usual restlessness.</p>
<p>Keith had made up his mind not to go back to school. He was
equally determined not to let himself be forced into any sort of
manual work. Besides having no knack for it, he had come to look
upon it as a social disgrace. Some other work must be found, for
well enough he knew that his father would not let him stay home
indefinitely doing nothing.</p>
<p>It was easy, however, to make up one's mind about what not to
do, but mighty hard to discover the right kind of thing to do.
Keith had no clue to start with at all, and to begin with all his
efforts led him into the blindest of blind alleys.</p>
<p>He plagued his mother with inquiries to which she had few or no
answers to give. He even deigned to consult Johan and found that he
already had found a place as errandboy in a store. A few questions
convinced Keith that such a life might be good enough for Johan but
not for a boy who, after all, had reached Lower Sixth in a public
school.</p>
<p>The situation was becoming desperate and Keith was watching his
father with steadily increasing concern, when at last a helpful
hint reached him from the most unexpected quarter.</p>
<p>"Why don't you look in the paper," Granny asked him one day.</p>
<p>"What for," was Keith's surprised counter-question.</p>
<p>"For work, of course. Look at the advertisements on the back
page."</p>
<p>"Do you think, Granny...." Keith hesitated.</p>
<p>"I don't think," retorted Granny. "I know."</p>
<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 35%;">
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="IV_XXIV"></a>XXIV</h2>
<br>
<p>Three weeks had gone. It was still early morning, and he was
studying a newspaper very carefully.</p>
<p>"What is it you find so interesting," his mother asked at
last.</p>
<p>"The advertisements," he explained without taking his eyes off
the paper.</p>
<p>"What advertisements?"</p>
<p>"Help wanted."</p>
<p>"Nonsense," she cried, putting down her sewing. "Are you still
thinking of leaving school?"</p>
<p>"Here is one about a volunteer wanted in a wholesale office,"
was his indirect reply. "It is on West Long street--in the same
house where Aunt Gertrude has her jewelry store. Do volunteers get
paid?"</p>
<p>"I don't know," his mother said absent-mindedly, her hands
resting on her lap in unwonted idleness. Then she woke up as from a
dream: "You should ask papa first."</p>
<p>"What's the use until I know whether I can get," Keith
parried.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later he bustled into Aunt Gertrude's store, where
she sat in a corner near the big show-window working at a strip of
embroidery that never got finished. She was a spinster with large
black hungry eyes in a very white face. She and Keith's mother had
been girl friends. Now she was running one of the two jewelry
stores owned by her brother.</p>
<p>She had heard of the position. It was in the office of Herr
Brockhaus on the second floor--a dealer in tailor's supplies. And
she had heard that he was a very nice man.</p>
<p>"Do you think I can get it," Keith demanded eagerly.</p>
<p>"Why don't you run up this minute and ask," she suggested.</p>
<p>Keith looked as if he had been to jump off a church steeple. But
in another minute he was climbing the stairs. His legs seemed
rather shaky and his tongue felt like a piece of wood. The moment
he opened the door, however, all his fears and hesitations were
gone. Once more he was the old Keith who had made a play of studies
and examinations.</p>
<p>Herr Brockhaus was a tall, youngish, good-looking man, a little
haughty of mien, but with a tendency to smile in quite friendly
fashion.</p>
<p>"I have as good as hired another boy who got here earlier than
you," he said in reply to Keith's inquiry. On seeing Keith's
dejected look, he laughed good-humouredly.</p>
<p>"There are plenty of other jobs," he suggested.</p>
<p>"But you look as if you would be kind to me and give to a chance
to learn," Keith heard himself saying to his own intense
astonishment.</p>
<p>"I can see that when you want a thing you want it real hard,"
Herr Brockhaus rejoined with another peasant laugh. "Well, I like
that. What kind of a hand do you write?"</p>
<p>"Awful," Keith confessed, "but I am going to learn better."</p>
<p>For a good long while Keith felt himself studied from top to
toe, and under that searching scrutiny he blushed as usual.</p>
<p>"I am willing to do anything that is required," he ventured to
ease the suspense.</p>
<p>"All right--what did you say your name was? Keith--I'll take
you, and tell the other boy that I changed my mind. When can you
begin?"</p>
<p>"Tod ... tomorrow," Keith corrected himself with a sudden
remembrance of his father.</p>
<p>"Good," said Herr Brockhaus. "Show up at eight. And I'll pay you
ten crowns a month the first year, although as a rule volunteers
don't get anything."</p>
<p>Keith walked home on air. The sun never shone more brightly than
that day. The tall old stone houses along West Long street looked
imposing and mysterious, as if they had been magic mansions full of
golden opportunities for bright little boys. School seemed years
away already. Lector Booklund was a dream.</p>
<p>His mother listened in silence to his wonderful tale. Then she
kissed him.</p>
<p>"When you have made a lot of money, will you present me with a
new black silk dress," she asked with a suspicious lustre in her
eyes.</p>
<p>"Anything you want, mamma," he promised solemnly. "When I begin
to make money, you'll never have to worry any more about
anything."</p>
<p>Again she had to kiss him.</p>
<p>He was then a little more than halfway through his fifteenth
year.</p>
<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 35%;">
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="IV_XXV"></a>XXV</h2>
<br>
<p>When his father came home that night, Keith hurried across the
room to meet him. "Papa," he cried full of subdued excitement and a
swelling of self-importance such as he had not experienced for ever
so long. "I have got a job."</p>
<p>"What kind of a job," asked the father quietly.</p>
<p>"In an office." And Keith sputtered out the details.</p>
<p>When the whole story was told, the father stood looking at him
enigmatically for a long while.</p>
<p>"Perhaps it is just as well," he said at last. "It certainly
will make things easier for me. But bear in mind what I now tell
you, boy: you will live to regret the chance you are throwing
away--a chance for which I would have given one of my hands when I
was of your age."</p>
<p>"Did you want me to go on," Keith asked uncertainly.</p>
<p>"I did--I always hoped that you should pass your university
examinations and wear the white cap."</p>
<p>"And what did you want me to become?"</p>
<p>"A civil engineer--that's the only real profession today."</p>
<p>The idea was too novel to be grasped quickly by the boy. His own
thoughts had never strayed in that direction, and his conception of
an engineer's duties and position was extremely vague.</p>
<p>"An engineer," he repeated. "But then I should not have studied
Latin."</p>
<p>"Of course not, but you chose it without asking my opinion
first."</p>
<p>Keith's surprise increased.</p>
<p>"Why didn't you tell me," he insisted.</p>
<p>"Because I wanted you to begin to shape your own life," the
father replied, "and I thought you knew what you wanted."</p>
<p>Keith could hardly believe his own ears.</p>
<p>"What do you want me to do now," he pleaded at last.</p>
<p>"What you feel you must," rejoined the father. "This concerns
your life, and not mine. And you must make up your own mind.
Whatever you decided, you have my good wishes, boy, and I shall try
to help you as far as I can."</p>
<p>For a moment Keith had a sense of never having known his father
before. Then a thought flashed through his head: why did he not
speak before?</p>
<p>He went into the parlour and stood at the window staring at the
gloomy facade of the distillers across the lane. A motley throng of
thoughts chased each other through his brain.</p>
<p>It was not yet too late. Nothing was settled. He could still
drop the job and go back to school if he wanted. But did he want
it?</p>
<p>The thought of school sent a slight shiver down his spine.</p>
<p>No, he was sick of it, of the teachers, of the tedious books, of
the boys who looked down upon him and kept him at arm's length all
the time, of everything that had made up his life for the last few
years.</p>
<p>He wanted change. He must have it.</p>
<p>Above all else, he wanted to be free, he wanted to do as he
pleased, and now he had found a way to it, he believed.</p>
<p>At that moment it seemed to him that his childhood suddenly had
come to an end, that his manhood had begun, and that all life lay
open before him.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
